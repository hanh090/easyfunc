<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Signed Java Web Start applications and applets that contain
signed and unsigned components could potentially be unsafe unless
the mixed code was intended by the application vendor. As of the
Java SE 6 Update 19 release (or later), when a program contains
both signed and unsigned components, a warning dialog is raised.
The following is an example of the dialog that the user may
see:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/mixedcode-warning.jpg" alt=
"Screen shot of Mixed Code Warning Dialog" width="516" height=
"265" /></p>
<p>Clicking the <em>More Information...</em> link brings up the
following panel:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/mixedcode-warning-moreinfo.jpg"
alt="Screen shot of the More Information Panel" width="388" height=
"392" /></p>
<p>Clicking <strong>Yes</strong> blocks potentially unsafe
components from running, and the program may terminate. If the user
clicks the <strong>No</strong> button, the application or applet
continues execution with some added protections.</p>
<p>Raising a warning is the default behavior, but there are options
available to manage how this situation is handled.</p>
<ul>
<li>For users and systems administrators, various protection
options are available. For more information, see <a href=
"#jcp">Mixed Code Protection Options for Users</a>.</li>
<li>For developers and deployers, two manifest attributes are
available. For more information, see <a href="#manifest">Deploying
Signed Applications and Applets Securely Without a Mixed Code
Warning</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<strong>Note:</strong> If any concepts are unclear, such as how to
modify a manifest file, or how to sign a jar file, or how to use a
deployment configuration file, see <a href="#info">For More
Information</a> for useful links.
<hr />
<h2><a name="jcp" id="jcp">Mixed Code Protection Options for
Users</a></h2>
There are two mechanisms for managing how mixed code programs are
handled.
<ul>
<li><b>From the Java Control Panel</b>
<p>You can manage how mixed code programs are handled via the Java
Control Panel. The following screen shot shows the four levels of
control available. See the <strong>Mixed code</strong> heading
towards the bottom of the panel.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/mixedcode-jcp.jpg" alt=
"Screen shot of Java Control Panel" width="440" height="486" /></p>
<p>How to access the Java Control Panel varies for each platform
and sometimes varies for different releases of a platform. On
Microsoft Windows Vista and XP, you can bring up the panel via
<code>Start menu &gt; Control Panel &gt; Java Control
Panel</code>.</p>
<p>The first three options enable the software protections, but
behave a bit differently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable - show warning if needed</strong><br />
This is the default setting. When a potential security risk is
encountered, a warning dialog is raised. Clicking
<strong>Yes</strong> blocks potentially unsafe components from
running and may terminate the program. When the user clicks
<strong>No</strong>, the application or applet continues execution
with some added protections (packages or resources that are later
encountered with the same names but have different trust levels,
i.e., sign vs unsigned, will not be loaded).</li>
<li><strong>Enable - hide warning and run with
protections</strong><br />
This option suppresses the warning dialog. The code executes as if
the user had clicked <strong>No</strong> from the warning
dialog.</li>
<li><strong>Enable - hide warning and don't run untrusted
code</strong><br />
This option suppresses the warning dialog and behaves as if the
user had clicked <strong>Yes</strong> from the warning dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final option, <strong>Disable verification</strong>, is not
recommended. This option completely disables the software from
checking for mixing trusted and untrusted code, leaving the user to
run potentially unsafe code with no warning and without the
additional protections.</p>
</li>
<li><b>From the <code>deployment.properties</code> File</b>
<p>The mixed code protection options can also be set by using the
<code>deployment.security.mixcode</code> deployment property, as
described in <a href=
"../deployment/deployment-guide/properties.html#properties">Deployment
Configuration File and Properties</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>deployment.security.mixcode=ENABLE</code>
<p>This option enables mixed code verification. When a potential
security risk is encountered, a warning dialog is raised. This is
the default value for this property.</p>
</li>
<li><code>deployment.security.mixcode=HIDE_RUN</code>
<p>This option suppresses the warning dialog. The code executes as
if the user had clicked <strong>No</strong> from the warning
dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><code>deployment.security.mixcode=HIDE_CANCEL</code>
<p>This option suppresses the warning dialog and behaves as if the
user had clicked <strong>Yes</strong> from the warning dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><code>deployment.security.mixcode=DISABLE</code>
<p>This option is not recommended. The software is disabled from
checking for mixing trusted and untrusted code, leaving the user to
run potentially unsafe code with no warning and without the
additional protections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<strong>Version note:</strong> To take advantage of these security
enhancements, users need to install the Java SE or Java for
Business 6 Update 19 release (or later) and use the new Java
Plugin, which is enabled by default. To use an earlier JRE with the
new Java Plugin, you need to install the Java for Business 5.0
Update 24 release (or later) or the Java for Business 1.4.2_26
release (or later) in order to enable the mixed code security
enhancement for those release families.<br />
<strong>Note 1</strong>: Mixed code checking for the 1.4.2 release
is available only for the Windows platform.<br />
<strong>Note 2</strong>: For Solaris, the new Java Plugin requires
Firefox 3 or later. Netscape 7 and Firefox 2 are not
supported.<br />
<strong>Note 3</strong>: For more information on which platforms
are supported by the new plugin, see the <a href=
"https://jdk6.dev.java.net/plugin2/" target="_blank">Release Notes
for the Next-Generation Java Plugin</a>.

<h2><a name="manifest" id="manifest">Deploying Signed Applications
and Applets Securely Without a Mixed Code Warning</a></h2>
<p>This section describes best practices for developers and
deployers to protect their applications and applets from being
maliciously re-purposed by replacing trusted components with
untrusted ones.</p>
<p>Two new JAR manifest attributes are available, as of Java SE 6
Update 19, for deploying signed applications and applets. A warning
dialog is not displayed when one of these manifest attributes is
included.</p>
<p>Developers and deployers should check their signed Java Web
Start applications and applets to determine if they mix signed and
unsigned code. If users of these applications and applets may
inadvertently download these applications and applets from rogue
websites, deploying or re-deploying with one of the following
attributes should be considered. Existing signed jars need to be
re-signed after adding one of these manifest attributes. Note:
source code of the classes and resources are not required for
re-signing with the new manifest entries.</p>
<h3><a name="trusted_only" id=
"trusted_only"><code>Trusted-Only</code> Attribute</a></h3>
<p>For applications and applets that do not require unsigned
components, the <code>Trusted-Only</code> attribute should be used.
No warning dialog will be displayed and an application or applet
that loads a jar file containing this attribute will not load any
untrusted classes or resources. This attribute prevents a signed
application or applet from being re-purposed with unsigned
components. You can specify <code>Trusted-Only</code>: true in the
manifest file. For example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Trusted-Only: true
Created-By: 1.6.0-internal (Sun Microsystems Inc.)
</pre>
<p>All classes and resources in the application or applet must be
signed and trusted.</p>
<h3><a name="trusted_library" id=
"trusted_library"><code>Trusted-Library</code> Attribute</a></h3>
<p>For applications and applets that are designed to allow unsigned
components, the <code>Trusted-Library</code> attribute should be
used. No warning dialog will be displayed and an application or
applet may load jar files containing untrusted classes or
resources. This attribute prevents signed components in an
application or applet from being re-purposed with unsigned
components. You can specify <code>Trusted-Library: true</code> in
the manifest file. For example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Trusted-Library: true
Created-By: 1.6.0-internal (Sun Microsystems Inc.)
</pre>
<p>All classes and resources in a jar file containing this manifest
attribute must be signed and trusted.</p>
<p>In a mixed code application or applet, all signed classes and
resources must be included in jar files that contain the
<code>Trusted-Library</code> attribute.</p>
All trusted library jars are loaded into a separate dedicated class
loader which is unique to the application or applet instance. This
new <code>Trusted-Library</code> loader is now the parent of the
normal Web Start or applet class loader. For backwards
compatibility with the original search order, both loaders
cooperate to implement a common class path. Consistent with prior
releases, jar files are lazily downloaded and opened as needed to
find requested classes and resources.
<p>Code in a jar file that is to be marked with the
<code>Trusted-Library</code> manifest attribute may need to be
modified slightly if it uses calls that are class loader dependent,
such as the single parameter version of
<code>Class.forName()</code>, <code>Class.getResource()</code>, and
<code>Class.getResourceAsStream()</code>, some variants of
<code>java.util.ResourceBundle.getBundle()</code>, and any other
methods which operate relative to their immediate caller's defining
loader. Changes only need to be made if the requested class or
resource might be found in a jar file which is not a
<code>Trusted-Library</code> (and is therefore loaded by the normal
Web Start or applet class loader).</p>
<p>Code in a <code>Trusted-Library</code> can look up the normal
loader by invoking
<code>Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()</code>. Note,
however, that there are uncommon circumstances in which
<code>getContextClassLoader()</code> may return <code>null</code>.
For example, this may happen when the garbage collector uses a JRE
system thread to invoke the <code>Object.finalize()</code> method
of an unreachable instance.</p>
<p>If you need to convert class to <code>Class.getResource()</code>
or <code>Class.getResourceAsStream()</code> to their
<code>ClassLoader</code> equivalents, remember to adjust the string
parameter as described by the documentation for those two methods.
If the original resource name began with <code>'/'</code>, then it
was an absolute name and the leading <code>'/'</code> simply needs
to be removed. Otherwise, determine if the class instance which was
the target of the <code>getResource</code> call is in a named
package. If it is an array you should first determine the
underlying component type of the array. Invoke
<code>Class.getName()</code> on the class or component type
instance. If the class name contains any <code>'.'</code>
characters, it is in a named package that will need to be prepended
to the original resource name. Determine the package name by
removing any characters after, and including, the trailing
<code>'.'</code> character. Next, replace any remaining
<code>'.'</code> characters with <code>'/'</code> characters.
Finally, add a trailing <code>'/'</code> and append the original
resource name string. This new string can now be passed to the
<code>ClassLoader</code> version of the <code>getResource()</code>
or <code>getResourceAsStream()</code> methods.</p>
<p>Generally, care must be taken to ensure that the code in the
trusted library is written in a careful and secure manner and is
otherwise compatible with being loaded in a separate class loader
instance from any remaining jars which are part of the application
and are loaded by the normal loader.</p>
<h2><a name="faq" id="faq">Mixed Code FAQ</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I develop and/or deploy
applications. How do I know whether I need to be concerned about
this issue?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: If you do not use the new <a href=
"#manifest">manifest entries</a> and you encounter the warning
dialog when running your signed application or applet, your program
contains mixed code and is affected.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="testing" id="testing"><strong>Question</strong></a>:
Is there a test I can run to determine whether I am affected?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Test your Java Web Start applications
and Java applets against Java SE or Java for Business 6 Update 19
or later. If you are running earlier release families, you should
additionally install and test your program under 5.0 Update 24 (or
later), or 1.4.2_26 (or later), as appropriate. If you see the
warning dialog, then the Java Web Start application or applet
contains mixed code.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What actions can I take?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: End users can click the "More
Information" link before deciding whether to click "Yes" or "No" in
response to the warning dialog. IT or System Administrators can
choose from one of the Mixed Code protection options and configure
enterprise desktops through the respective deployment properties
described above. Developers and deployers can use the new manifest
entries to protect their applications from tampering. No warning
dialog will be displayed when one of these manifest entries is
used.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What should Java ISVs, OEMs, and
application vendors do with their code?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Two <a href="#manifest">manifest
entries</a> are available to application vendors to deploy, or
re-deploy, their Java Web Start applications and Java applets.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>:What versions of Java SE and Java for
Business are affected?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The following releases from Oracle are
affected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18 and earlier</li>
<li>Java for Business 5.0 Update 23 and earlier</li>
<li>Java for Business 1.4.2_25 and earlier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a name="internet" id="internet"><strong>Question</strong></a>:
What about Java applets and Java Web Start applications from the
Internet, do I need to be concerned about those?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Users will see a warning dialog if a
signed Java Web Start application or Java applet contains mixed
code regardless of whether it is downloaded from the Internet or
Intranet.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What if I am behind a corporate
firewall?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The mixed code issue applies. See the
<a href="#internet">question</a> on applets and applications from
the Internet. 
<!--<strong>Question</strong>: Who can I call for more information and
advice on this issue?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Java for Business customers
may call Sun Services for more information.--></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Is this an issue for Oracle JRockit?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I am using an implementation of Java
from another vendor. Are they affected in the same way?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Please contact your vendor for advice
on their implementation.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: What are the risks to remaining on
Java SE 6u18 (or earlier) to avoid seeing the warnings?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Java SE 6 Update 19 (or later) contains
the latest security fixes and Oracle recommends that customers use
the latest release.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: If I move to 6 Update 19 or later,
what type of testing do I need to consider?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: See the <a href="#testing">question</a>
on testing. In addition, the release notes for each update release
documents the latest changes included.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I am running on Solaris and/or Linux
and I use Java applets. How do I leverage these security features?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: You need to use Firefox 3 and the
next-generation Java Plugin. You can get Firefox 3 through <a href=
"http://www.sunfreeware.com/mozilla.html" target=
"_blank">sunfreeware.com</a>. They have a full list of <a href=
"ftp://ftp.sunfreeware.com/pub/freeware/mozilla/" target=
"_blank">Firefox packages</a> available. See <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/manual-plugin-install-solaris-142922.html">
Manual Installation and Registration of Solaris Plugin</a> or
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/manual-plugin-install-linux-136395.html">
Manual Installation and Registration of Linux Plugin</a>, as
appropriate, for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I am a developer. What are the new
security exceptions that are added with this enhancement?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The following
<code>SecurityException</code> messages are described for
informational and debugging purposes only. The actual message
contents may change between different implementations and
releases.</p>
<p>These <code>SecurityExceptions</code> are thrown when a jar file
contains one of the new manifest attributes and the jar file itself
contains untrusted components.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
attempted to open sandboxed jar "+ url +" as Trusted-Only
attempted to open sandboxed jar "+ url +" as Trusted-Library
</pre>
The following <code>SecurityException</code> is thrown when a jar
file contains the new <code>Trusted-Only</code> manifest attribute
and untrusted components have previously been accessed.
<pre class="codeblock">
attempted to open Trusted-Only jar "+ url +" on sandboxed loader
</pre>
The following <code>SecurityException</code> is thrown when at
least one jar containing the <code>Trusted-Only</code> manifest
attribute has been opened and a subsequent attempt is made to load
an untrusted component.
<pre class="codeblock">
Trusted-Only loader attempted to load sandboxed resource from "+ url"
</pre>
The following two <code>SecurityExceptions</code> are thrown when
mixed components are first detected and a decision is made to
disallow mixing. In the first case, everything previosly loaded was
trusted and then an attempt was made to load an untrusted
component. The second case is the reverse condition.
<pre class="codeblock">
trusted loader attempted to load sandboxed resource from "+ url"
sandboxed loader attempted to load trusted resource from "+ url"
</pre>
The following two <code>SecurityExceptions</code> are thrown after
mixed components had previously been detected and a decision was
made to allow them to coexist. The exceptions indicate that a
component name collision (resource name or class package name) was
detected between trusted and untrusted components and the request
to load the resource or class was denied.
<pre class="codeblock">
"resource \"" + name + "\" does not match trust level of other resources of the same name"
"class \"" + packageName + "\" does not match trust level of other classes in the same package"
</pre>
The following two <code>SecurityExceptions</code> are thrown when
untrusted components have been previously accessed, an attempt to
load a trusted component was previously detected, and a decision
was made to allow mixed components to coexist, and a jar containing
trusted components is opened and a component name collision is
detected between trusted and untrusted components.
<pre class="codeblock">
"untrusted resource \"" + name + "\" in class path"
"untrusted class package \"" + packageName + "\" in class path"
</pre></li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I have a mixed code Java Web Start
application which cannot be easily updated to use the
<code>Trusted-Library</code> manifest attribute. Can I sign the jar
files in the sandboxed JNLP without having to change the JNLP to
request the <code>all-permissions</code> security model?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, with some limitations beginning
with Java Web Start in Java SE or Java for Business Update 21. The
sandboxed jar files must be signed in the same way (same signing
certificates) as one or more of the trusted jar files in a JNLP
file that uses the <code>all-permissions</code> security model, and
the trusted jar file must be opened by Java Web Start prior to any
sandboxed resource being loaded which shares the same signer. This
means the trusted jar file must be earlier in Java Web Start's jar
search order or it is triggered to load independent of the simple
search order by use of the jar indexing feature. In Java Web Start,
the main application JNLP's jars are searched first, followed in
declaration order by any JNLP extensions. Jar files labeled within
a JNLP as "eager" are searched first, followed by "lazy" jar files,
followed by any jar files labeled as using the "part" feature.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: I have Java on my phone. Is that
affected by this issue?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No, Java ME is not affected.</p>
