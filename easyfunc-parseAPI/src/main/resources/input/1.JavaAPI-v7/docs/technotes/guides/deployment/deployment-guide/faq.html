<h2><a name="answers" id="answers"></a>Questions and Answers:</h2>
<p><strong><a name="automatic" id="automatic"></a>Q. I have
&quot;Check for Updates Automatically&quot; checked in the Java
Control Panel, but scheduled automatic updates do not seem to
happening. Is there something wrong?</strong></p>
<p>A: The automatic update feature works only on Windows 2000 with
SP3 and WindowsXP. If you are running on one of the other supported
operating system, this feature will not work. If you want to do an
update, use the <strong>Update Now</strong> button for manually
updating Java.</p>
<p><strong><a name="small" id="small"></a>Q: I downloaded the
installer and it is only 200KB. Why is it so small?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Java installer is designed for Install On Demand. It will
download more installer files based on user selection and system
configuration. Using this installer helps users avoid downloading
large amounts of unnecessary files.</p>
<p><strong><a name="reboot" id="reboot"></a>Q: Why does Java Update
ask me to reboot?</strong></p>
<p>A: Rebooting is sometimes required because installing Windows
Installer 2.0 the Microsoft technology used by the Java installer
requires rebooting.</p>
<p>Note: Java Installer now detects Java enabled Mozilla browsers
locked files and will prompt you to close the browser so that a
reboot can be avoided.</p>
<p><strong><a name="version" id="version"></a>Q: I had the Java
Control Panel open for Java Update and the About tab showed version
x.x.x. Then I ran Java Update and it still showed version x.x.x.
Why is this?</strong></p>
<p>A: You need to close and restart the Java Control Panel to get
the updated Control Panel.</p>
<p><strong><a name="netscape" id="netscape"></a>Q: Netscape/Mozilla
is not working correctly with Java Plug-in. Why?</strong></p>
<p>A: First close all the browsers sessions. If this does not work,
reboot the system and try again.</p>
<p><strong><a name="other_drive" id="other_drive"></a>Q: I try to
install on the <code>D:\</code> drive and Java Update is still
installing files onto the <code>C:\</code> drive. Why?</strong></p>
<p>A: Regardless of whether an alternate target directory was
selected, Java Update needs to install some update files on the
Windows system drive . Doing so saves download time on future
updates to the latest version of Java.</p>
<p><strong><a name="uninstall" id="uninstall"></a>Q: How can I
uninstall the Java Update version I just installed?</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to accomplish this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you want to uninstall the JRE, use the &quot;Add/Remove
Programs&quot; utility in the Microsoft Windows Control Panel
(Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control Panel to get to &quot;Add/Remove
Programs&quot;).</li>
<li>Alternatively, if you still have the original installation
program that you used to install the JRE, you can double-click on
it. This will take you to a screen with Modify and Remove options.
Select Remove to uninstall the JRE. Note that you must be connected
to the Internet for this to work.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><a name="connection_settings" id=
"connection_settings"></a>Q. After the JRE bootstrap installer is
downloaded and executed, why does the message &quot;<em>This
installer cannot proceed with the current Internet Connection
settings of your system. In your Windows Control Panel, please
check Internet Options -&gt; Connections to make sure the settings
and proxy information are correct.</em>&quot; appear?.</strong></p>
<p>A: The JRE bootstrap installer uses the system Internet
Connection settings to connect to the web for downloading extra
files. If you are behind a firewall and require proxy settings,
make sure the proxy settings in Internet Options/Internet
Properties are set up properly (Start-&gt;Control
Panel-&gt;Internet Options/Internet
Properties-&gt;Connections-&gt;LAN Settings ...).</p>
<p>If you can browser the external web (i.e., outside the firewall)
with Internet Explorer, then your proxy settings are properly set
up. The installer doesn't understand the proxy settings specified
in Netscape/Mozilla.</p>
<p><a name="processes" id="processes"></a><strong>Q: I found two
processes&#8212;<code>jucheck.exe</code> and
<code>jusched.exe</code>&#8212;running in the background of my
system after installing JRE. Is there a way to shut them
down?</strong></p>
<p>A: <code>jusched.exe</code> is the scheduler process of Java
Update; <code>jucheck.exe</code> is the process for
checking/performing updates in Java Update. These processes run
automatically and transparently to users. To shutdown these
processes, simply uncheck the &quot;Check for Updates
Automatically&quot; checkbox in the Update tab of Java Control
Panel.</p>
<p><br />
<strong><a name="vm" id="vm"></a>Q . After Java Update updates my
system, my browser still uses the Microsoft VM, or an older version
of the Sun Java VM, to run applets. What's wrong?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you installed the JRE through the Custom option but
unchecked the browser selections, you may run into this situation.
To fix the problem, go to the Browser tab in Java Control Panel and
check the browsers that you want to run the newly installed version
of Java.</p>
<p><strong><a name="offline" id="offline"></a>Q: When I click the
&quot;Update Now&quot; button from the Java Control Panel, it
complains about the system being &quot;offline.&quot; What does
that means?</strong></p>
<p>A: Java Update can only be run if the system is connected to the
network. A system that is not connected to the network is referred
to as being &quot;offline&quot;. When the <strong>Update
Now</strong> button is clicked, it will check the online/offline
status of your system. If your system is not currently connected to
the network or dial-up networking is disconnected, the error
message will show up. Check that your system is currently connected
to the network and try it again.</p>
<p><strong><a name="available" id="available"></a>Q: I followed the
instruction to install version x.x.x. After the installation and
reboot, a message popped-up from system tray saying an update is
available for download. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: The message is part of the Java Auto Update mechanism, which
detects at user login time if a newer version of the JRE is
available for download . You may simply click on the system tray
Java Update icon to download and install the update.</p>
<p><strong><a name="registry" id="registry"></a>Q: I want to run
Java Update but I am afraid it may cause problems on my computer.
What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: You may want to backup your Windows registry before testing
out Java Update. The following command will export the necessary
registry keys to a file:</p>
<p><code>regedit -e reg.1 -t HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br />
regedit -e reg.2 -t HKEY_CURRENT_USER<br />
regedit -e reg.3 -t HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code></p>
<p>To fully restore the registry keys, the following command can be
used to import the exported registry values:</p>
<p><code>regedit -i reg.1<br />
regedit -i reg.2<br />
regedit -i reg.3</code></p>
<p><strong><a name="1606"></a>Q: I encountered the error
<em>&quot;Error 1606: Could not access network location file
MSI/CAB and still fail after immediate retry.&quot;</em> when
running the Java SE installer.What does it mean?</strong></p>
<p>A: This problem occurs when the server is too busy or when the
network is too congested to serve the file. Please retry by running
the installer again.</p>
<p><strong><a name="package_not_open" id="package_not_open"></a>Q:
I encountered the error <em>&quot;This installation package could
not be opened. Contact the application vendor to verify that this
is a valid Windows Installer package.&quot;</em> when running the
Java SE installer</strong>.</p>
<p>A: There are several possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network connection fails</li>
<li>Download manager software interrupts the download process,
e.g., GetRight;</li>
<li>TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) programs, like Norton Anti
Virus, may distract the installation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these problems, please make sure third-party
downloader/TSR programs are turned off and the network connection
is setup properly. Also, if a proxy is in use, make sure that proxy
authentication is turned off.<br />
<br />
<strong><a name="1311"></a>Q: Error 1311: Source File Not Found.
Could not find <code>C:\Downloads\ja555000.cab</code>.</strong></p>
<p>A: This is a known MSI engine problem. See following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;[LN];Q290106</code></li>

<code>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;[LN];290896</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="1722"></a>Q: Error 1722. There is a problem
with this windows installer package. A program run as part of the
setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or
package vender.</strong><br />
