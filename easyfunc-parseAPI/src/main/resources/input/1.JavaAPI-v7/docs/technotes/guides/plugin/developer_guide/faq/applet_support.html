<p><b>Q: Why should I encourage people to use the Java
Platform?</b><br /></p>
<p><b>A:</b> The Java Platform is richer than its predecessors in
functionality, performance, and security options. As a developer,
you want the users of your software to have the most
feature-complete Java platform possible so that the full range of
APIs and libraries are available for your applications. If your
customers are using the Java Platform, you can write more powerful,
robust, and full-featured applications and applets. And with the
Java Platform the performance of your code will be better too.</p>
<p>By using the latest Java Plug-in with <tt>APPLET</tt> tag
support, you can help to ensure that clients running your applets
will have the latest Java Platform.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I continue to use <tt>OBJECT</tt> tags to call my
applets?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes. Even though the Java Plug-in has been enhanced to
support <tt>APPLET</tt> tags, it is fully backward compatible with
existing web pages that use <tt>OBJECT</tt> tags to launch
applets.</p>
<p><b>Q: My applet fails with a <code>ClassFormatError</code>.
What's wrong?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> This problem may be caused by bytecode generated by
old compilers. Such bytecode may not conform to the virtual machine
specification, which is more strictly enforced by recent releases
of the JRE.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why doesn't Java Plug-in load my applet's cab
file?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> The Java Plug-in supports applet packaging in
<code>.jar</code> files. It does not support the Microsoft
proprietary <i><code>.</code></i><code>cab</code> file format.
Therefore any applets packaged in Microsoft's
<i><code>.</code></i><code>cab file</code> format will not load in
JRE/Java Plug-in.</p>
<p><b>Q: Will my Authenticode-signed applet work with Sun's
JRE/Java Plug-in?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No. The Sun JRE/Java Plug-in does not support
Microsoft proprietary technology such as Authenicode signing and
<i><code>.</code></i><code>cab</code> file formats. Signed applets
that rely on Microsoft's Authenticode technology will not load in
JRE/Java Plug-in.</p>
<p><b>Q: My applet uses J/Direct, AFC, and WFC, etc. Will it work
in Sun's JRE/Java Plug-in?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No. Libraries for these and other proprietary
Microsoft technologies are not included with JRE/Java Plug-in.
Applets that rely on these Microsoft proprietary technologies will
not work properly when run on JRE/Java Plug-in.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why does my applet throw a
<code>NullPointerException</code> from the AWT Dispatch Event
thread?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> The events that occur during applet startup and
shutdown may differ between the Microsoft and Sun implementation of
the Java platform. For example, the logic in an applet may rely on
the applet being visible when
<tt>Applet.start()</tt>/<tt>Applet.stop()</tt> is called. That
condition may be true when the applet is run on Microsoft's
implementation but may not be true on Sun's impelementation.</p>
<p>Applets that rely on specific events that occur during startup
and shutdown on Microsoft's implementation of the Java platform may
not work properly with JRE/Java Plug-in. The most common symptom of
this type of problem is a <tt>NullPointerException</tt> from the
AWT Dispatch Event thread.</p>
<p><b>Q: Why does my applet throw a <code>ClassCastException</code>
from the AWT Dispatch Event thread?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> The number of containers between the applet and the
encompassing frame are different in the Microsoft and Sun
implementations. Therefore, an applet that relies on the frame
being at some particular level of containment in the Microsoft VM,
without navigating the entire AWT hierarchical component tree, is
likely to fail when run on Sun's JRE/Java Plug-in. The most common
symptom of this problem is a <tt>ClassCastException</tt> from the
AWT Dispatch Event thread.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in support Java-JavaScript
communication?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, Java Plug-in supports basic, bidirectional
Java-JavaScript communication. The following, however, is a known
incompatibility.</p>
<p>In the Microsoft implementation, applet methods and properties
exposed in JavaScript are exactly the same as the methods and
fields in the applet object. In Java Plug-in, an applet's methods
and properties are exposed in JavaScript through
JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> introspection, which
treats the applet's fields in a different manner than the Microsoft
VM. Therefore, JavaScript accessing fields in an applet object may
not work the same when run on JRE/Java Plug-in.</p>
