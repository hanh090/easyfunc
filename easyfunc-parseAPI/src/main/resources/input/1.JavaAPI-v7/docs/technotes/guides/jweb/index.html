<h2><a id="intro" name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Java technology based solutions are
versatile when developed with good design principles. There are
three major kinds of solutions depending on their deployment
mechanism and execution context:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Applets &ndash; These solutions run
in the context of a web browser. They utilize the browser
capabilities like session cookies, DOM access etc. Applets may be
deployed by using Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) or by using
applet tag attributes.</p>
</li>
<li>Java Web Start applications - Java Web Start applications are
deployed via a browser the first time. Once the application is
downloaded and the user has accepted its security certificate, it
behaves almost like a standalone application. When run standalone
from the user's desktop using Java Web Start, updates to the
application are automatically downloaded.</li>
<li>Standalone solutions &ndash; Standalone solutions do not
require a browser session for execution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Applets and Java Web Start applications are now referred to as
<em>rich internet applications</em> (RIAs) - Java programs that
take advantage of the Internet.</p>
<p>Here is an example of Swing <code>JTree</code> functionality
deployed as a Java applet and Java Web Start application.</p>

<p>The basic steps to build a RIA are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="images/jweb_dev.jpg" alt=
"Component based design and deployment" width="791" height=

<h2><a id="design" name="design"></a>Design</h2>
<p>In the past, the decision of whether to deploy a RIA inside the
browser as an applet, or outside the browser as a Java Web Start
application, could significantly impact the design of the solution.
With new technology introduced in the Java SE 6 update 10 release,
these two deployment options have been substantially unified, so
that properly structured programs can be easily deployed either
inside or outside the browser.<br />
<br />
A key methodology to follow during the design of your app is to use
a <em>component-based architecture</em>. Traditional applications
tend to construct their user interfaces, including the top-level
Frame, in the <code>main</code> method. This programming style
prevents easy re-deployment of the app in the browser, because it
assumes that the app creates its own Frame. When running in the
browser as an applet, the applet is implicitly the container that
should hold the user interface for the app, and no top-level Frame
is needed or desired.<br />
<br />
Instead, during the development of your app, try to organize its
functionality into one or more components that can be composed
together. In this context, the term "component" refers to a GUI
element that subclasses from the AWT <code>Component</code> class,
the Swing <code>JComponent</code> class, or another subclass.
Rather than phrasing the app in terms of various methods which
build user interfaces and return or show them, instead phrase the
app in terms of various <code>Component</code> subclasses, each of
which adds their portion of the user interface to themselves. Then
the app, which at that point is just a Component (and perhaps, for
example, a menu bar) can easily be added to any kind of Container.
The container might be a top-level Frame or an Applet. Using this
methodology and architecture makes it easy to redeploy the app
either inside or outside the browser, and allows this deployment
decision to be changed at essentially any time without
significantly impacting the development cycle of the app.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.5.0/demos/jfc/SwingSet2/SwingSet2.html"
target="_blank">SwingSet2</a> demo is an example that shows how to
layout components in a single cohesive unit. The constructor of the
ButtonDemo class instantiates and lays out all required user
interface components into one master panel. The DemoModule class is
only responsible for displaying this master panel as an applet.
This design enables the ButtonDemo to be reused or ported easily to
another applet or application.</p>
<p>Should you decide to develop an applet, you'll probably want to
use the <i>Next Generation Plugin</i>, which has been heavily
refactored for reliability and cross-browser compatibility. To help
make that choice, see the <a href="decision_guide.html">Rich
Internet Applications Decision Guide</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="dev" name="dev"></a>Development</h2>
<p>Having decided on the type of client app you plan to build, the
next step is to build it. For applets, use the <a href=
"applet/applet_dev_guide.html">Applet Developer's Guide</a> to set
up the applet, get the browser and the applet talking to each
other, and to communicate with other applets. For Java Web Start
applications, use the <a href=
"../javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Java Web Start
Developer's Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Debugging is a natural part of development. In addition to using
your Java IDE or the Java debugger, you can use the debugging
facilities in the <a href=
"../deployment/deployment-guide/console.html">Java Console</a>, as
well as the JVM's <a href=
"../deployment/deployment-guide/tracing_logging.html">Tracing and
Logging</a>&nbsp;capabilities.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/index.html">Deployment
trail</a> in the Java Tutorials is a comprehensive resource to
learn more about the development and deployment of RIAs.</p>
<h2><a id="depl" name="depl"></a>Deployment</h2>
<p>Deployment is a multi-step process. Many of the steps are
optional, but they are all intended to improve the end-user's
experience--something that has undergone an end-to-end facelift. .
An overview of deployment related steps is shown next. See the
<a href="deployment_advice.html">Rich Internet Applications
Deployment Advice</a> topic for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>JNLP File:</b> A JNLP file is created for Java Web Start
applications and applets that will be deployed using JNLP.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Security Certificate</b>: If the application has only
limited interactions with the user's system, then the applet or
Java Web Start APIs will have been sufficient. But if you needed to
use other APIs that affect the user's system, the application will
need access permissions, and you'll need to add a security
certificate when you deploy the app. See the <a href=
"../deployment/deployment-guide/security.html">security</a> page
for more information.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>JAR Indexing:</b> To keep the app from downloading JAR files
before they're needed, you'll want to use <i>JAR Indexing.</i>
<a href="../jar/jar.html#JARIndex">Jar Indexing</a> works both for
applets and Java Web Start applications. With Jar Indexing, the
main jar contains an index file that tells which packages are in
the other jars. When lazy-loading a resource, the underlying
classloader uses the index to know what jar file to
download.<br /></li>
<li><b>Pack200 Compression:</b> You'll want to use <a href=
"tools/pack200.html">Pack200 compression</a> to minimize download
time for the apps JAR files.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Deployment Toolkit:</b> Finally, you'll want to use the
<a href="deployment_advice.html#deplToolkit">Deployment Toolkit</a>
to set up your web page with cross-browser JavaScript you need to
launch your app. The deployment toolkit is essentially a set of
JavaScript functions that ensure deployment of applets consistently
across various browsers.</li>
