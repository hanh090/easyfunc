			Utility class for HTML form encoding. This class contains static methods for converting a String to the application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME format. For more information about HTML form encoding, consult the HTML specification. When encoding a String, the following rules apply: The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" through "9" remain the same. The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same. The space character " " is converted into a plus sign "+". All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into one or more bytes using some encoding scheme. Then each byte is represented by the 3-character string "%xy", where xy is the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte. The recommended encoding scheme to use is UTF-8. However, for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is not specified, then the default encoding of the platform is used. For example using UTF-8 as the encoding scheme the string "The string ü@foo-bar" would get converted to "The+string+%C3%BC%40foo-bar" because in UTF-8 the character ü is encoded as two bytes C3 (hex) and BC (hex), and the character @ is encoded as one byte 40 (hex).

					Deprecated. The resulting string may vary depending on the platform's default encoding. Instead, use the encode(String,String) method to specify the encoding. Translates a string into x-www-form-urlencoded format. This method uses the platform's default encoding as the encoding scheme to obtain the bytes for unsafe characters.

				<description>
					Translates a string into application/x-www-form-urlencoded format using a specific encoding scheme. This method uses the supplied encoding scheme to obtain the bytes for unsafe characters. Note: The World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation states that UTF-8 should be used. Not doing so may introduce incompatibilites.
