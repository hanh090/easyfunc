		</name>
		<description>
			Class PrinterStateReason is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that provides additional information about the printer's current state, i.e., information that augments the value of the printer's PrinterState attribute. Class PrinterStateReason defines standard printer state reason values. A Print Service implementation only needs to report those printer state reasons which are appropriate for the particular implementation; it does not have to report every defined printer state reason. Instances of PrinterStateReason do not appear in a Print Service's attribute set directly. Rather, a PrinterStateReasons attribute appears in the Print Service's attribute set. The PrinterStateReasons attribute contains zero, one, or more than one PrinterStateReason objects which pertain to the Print Service's status, and each PrinterStateReason object is associated with a Severity level of REPORT (least severe), WARNING, or ERROR (most severe). The printer adds a PrinterStateReason object to the Print Service's PrinterStateReasons attribute when the corresponding condition becomes true of the printer, and the printer removesthe PrinterStateReason object again when the corresponding condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Service's overall PrinterState also changed. IPP Compatibility: The string values returned by each individual PrinterStateReason and associated Severity object's toString() methods, concatenated together with a hyphen ("-") in between, gives the IPP keyword value for a PrinterStateReasons. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason OTHER
				</name>
				<description>
					The printer has detected an error other than ones listed below.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason MEDIA_NEEDED
				</name>
				<description>
					A tray has run out of media.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason MEDIA_JAM
				</name>
				<description>
					The device has a media jam.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason MOVING_TO_PAUSED
				</name>
				<description>
					Someone has paused the printer, but the device(s) are taking an appreciable time to stop. Later, when all output has stopped, the PrinterState becomes STOPPED, and the PAUSED value replaces the MOVING_TO_PAUSED value in the PrinterStateReasons attribute. This value must be supported if the printer can be paused and the implementation takes significant time to pause a device in certain circumstances.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason PAUSED
				</name>
				<description>
					Someone has paused the printer and the printer's PrinterState is STOPPED. In this state, a printer must not produce printed output, but it must perform other operations requested by a client. If a printer had been printing a job when the printer was paused, the Printer must resume printing that job when the printer is no longer paused and leave no evidence in the printed output of such a pause. This value must be supported if the printer can be paused.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason SHUTDOWN
				</name>
				<description>
					Someone has removed a printer from service, and the device may be powered down or physically removed. In this state, a printer must not produce printed output, and unless the printer is realized by a print server that is still active, the printer must perform no other operations requested by a client. If a printer had been printing a job when it was shut down, the printer need not resume printing that job when the printer is no longer shut down. If the printer resumes printing such a job, it may leave evidence in the printed output of such a shutdown, e.g. the part printed before the shutdown may be printed a second time after the shutdown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason CONNECTING_TO_DEVICE
				</name>
				<description>
					The printer has scheduled a job on the output device and is in the process of connecting to a shared network output device (and might not be able to actually start printing the job for an arbitrarily long time depending on the usage of the output device by other servers on the network).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason TIMED_OUT
				</name>
				<description>
					The server was able to connect to the output device (or is always connected), but was unable to get a response from the output device.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason STOPPING
				</name>
				<description>
					The printer is in the process of stopping the device and will be stopped in a while. When the device is stopped, the printer will change the PrinterState to STOPPED. The STOPPING reason is never an error, even for a printer with a single output device. When an output device ceases accepting jobs, the printer's PrinterStateReasons will have this reason while the output device completes printing.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason STOPPED_PARTLY
				</name>
				<description>
					When a printer controls more than one output device, this reason indicates that one or more output devices are stopped. If the reason's severity is a report, fewer than half of the output devices are stopped. If the reason's severity is a warning, half or more but fewer than all of the output devices are stopped.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalPrinterStateReason SPOOL_AREA_FULL
				</name>
				<description>
					The limit of persistent storage allocated for spooling has been reached. The printer is temporarily unable to accept more jobs. The printer will remove this reason when it is able to accept more jobs. This value should be used by a non-spooling printer that only accepts one or a small number jobs at a time or a spooling printer that has filled the spool space.
