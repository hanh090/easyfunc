			public class DataTruncation  extends SQLWarning
		</name>
		<description>
			An exception thrown as a DataTruncation exception (on writes) or reported as a DataTruncation warning (on reads) when a data values is unexpectedly truncated for reasons other than its having execeeded MaxFieldSize. The SQLstate for a DataTruncation during read is 01004. The SQLstate for a DataTruncation during write is 22001.

				<description>
					Creates a DataTruncation object with the SQLState initialized to 01004 when read is set to true and 22001 when read is set to false, the reason set to "Data truncation", the vendor code set to 0, and the other fields set to the given values. The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a call to the Throwable.initCause(java.lang.Throwable) method.
