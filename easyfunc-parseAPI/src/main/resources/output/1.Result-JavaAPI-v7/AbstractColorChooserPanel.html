			public abstract class AbstractColorChooserPanel  extends JPanel

		<description>
			This is the abstract superclass for color choosers. If you want to add a new color chooser panel into a JColorChooser, subclass this class. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

					Invoked automatically when the model's state changes. It is also called by installChooserPanel to allow you to set up the initial state of your chooser. Override this method to update your ChooserPanel.

			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etMnemonic()
				</name>
				<description>
					Provides a hint to the look and feel as to the KeyEvent.VK constant that can be used as a mnemonic to access the panel. A return value <= 0 indicates there is no mnemonic. The return value here is a hint, it is ultimately up to the look and feel to honor the return value in some meaningful way. This implementation returns 0, indicating the AbstractColorChooserPanel does not support a mnemonic, subclasses wishing a mnemonic will need to override this.

			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etDisplayedMnemonicIndex()
				</name>
				<description>
					Provides a hint to the look and feel as to the index of the character in getDisplayName that should be visually identified as the mnemonic. The look and feel should only use this if getMnemonic returns a value > 0. The return value here is a hint, it is ultimately up to the look and feel to honor the return value in some meaningful way. For example, a look and feel may wish to render each AbstractColorChooserPanel in a JTabbedPane, and further use this return value to underline a character in the getDisplayName. This implementation returns -1, indicating the AbstractColorChooserPanel does not support a mnemonic, subclasses wishing a mnemonic will need to override this.
