			Prevents the mapping of a JavaBean property/type to XML representation. The @XmlTransient annotation is useful for resolving name collisions between a JavaBean property name and a field name or preventing the mapping of a field/property. A name collision can occur when the decapitalized JavaBean property name and a field name are the same. If the JavaBean property refers to the field, then the name collision can be resolved by preventing the mapping of either the field or the JavaBean property using the @XmlTransient annotation. When placed on a class, it indicates that the class shouldn't be mapped to XML by itself. Properties on such class will be mapped to XML along with its derived classes, as if the class is inlined. Usage The @XmlTransient annotation can be used with the following program elements: a JavaBean property field class @XmlTransientis mutually exclusive with all other JAXB defined annotations. See "Package Specification" in javax.xml.bind.package javadoc for additional common information. Example: Resolve name collision between JavaBean property and field name      // Example: Code fragment     public class USAddress {           // The field name "name" collides with the property name         // obtained by bean decapitalization of getName() below         @XmlTransient public String name;           String getName() {..};         String setName() {..};     }         <!-- Example: XML Schema fragment -->     <xs:complexType name="USAddress">       <xs:sequence>         <xs:element name="name" type="xs:string"/>       </xs:sequence>     </xs:complexType>
