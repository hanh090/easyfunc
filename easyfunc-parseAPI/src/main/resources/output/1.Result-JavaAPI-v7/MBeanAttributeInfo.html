			Describes an MBean attribute exposed for management. Instances of this class are immutable. Subclasses may be mutable but this is not recommended.

				<description>
					This constructor takes the name of a simple attribute, and Method objects for reading and writing the attribute. The Descriptor of the constructed object will include fields contributed by any annotations on the Method objects that contain the DescriptorKey meta-annotation.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicObject맊lone()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a shallow clone of this instance. The clone is obtained by simply calling super.clone(), thus calling the default native shallow cloning mechanism implemented by Object.clone(). No deeper cloning of any internal field is made. Since this class is immutable, cloning is chiefly of interest to subclasses.

				<description>
					Description copied from class:Object Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the toString method returns a string that "textually represents" this object. The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read. It is recommended that all subclasses override this method. The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character `@', and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of:    getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())

				<description>
					Description copied from class:Object Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by HashMap. The general contract of hashCode is: Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application. If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the Object.equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables. As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer, but this implementation technique is not required by the JavaTM programming language.)
