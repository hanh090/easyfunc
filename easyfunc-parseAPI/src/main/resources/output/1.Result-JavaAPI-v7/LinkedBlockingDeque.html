			public class LinkedBlockingDeque<E>  extends AbstractQueue<E>  implements BlockingDeque<E>, Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			An optionally-bounded blocking deque based on linked nodes. The optional capacity bound constructor argument serves as a way to prevent excessive expansion. The capacity, if unspecified, is equal to Integer.MAX_VALUE. Linked nodes are dynamically created upon each insertion unless this would bring the deque above capacity. Most operations run in constant time (ignoring time spent blocking). Exceptions include remove, removeFirstOccurrence, removeLastOccurrence, contains, iterator.remove(), and the bulk operations, all of which run in linear time. This class and its iterator implement all of the optional methods of the Collection and Iterator interfaces. This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

					Description copied from interface: BlockingDeque Inserts the specified element at the end of this deque if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, throwing an IllegalStateException if no space is currently available. When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable to use offerLast.

			<method>
				<name>
					public int remainingCapacity()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of additional elements that this deque can ideally (in the absence of memory or resource constraints) accept without blocking. This is always equal to the initial capacity of this deque less the current size of this deque. Note that you cannot always tell if an attempt to insert an element will succeed by inspecting remainingCapacity because it may be the case that another thread is about to insert or remove an element.

				<name>
					public int drainTo(Collection<? super E> c)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: BlockingQueue Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them to the given collection. This operation may be more efficient than repeatedly polling this queue. A failure encountered while attempting to add elements to collection c may result in elements being in neither, either or both collections when the associated exception is thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in IllegalArgumentException. Further, the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

					public int drainTo(Collection<? super E> c,            int maxElements)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: BlockingQueue Removes at most the given number of available elements from this queue and adds them to the given collection. A failure encountered while attempting to add elements to collection c may result in elements being in neither, either or both collections when the associated exception is thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in IllegalArgumentException. Further, the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

					public void push(E e)

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public E pop()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: Deque Pops an element from the stack represented by this deque. In other words, removes and returns the first element of this deque. This method is equivalent to Deque.removeFirst().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean remove(Object o)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this deque. If the deque does not contain the element, it is unchanged. More formally, removes the first element e such that o.equals(e) (if such an element exists). Returns true if this deque contained the specified element (or equivalently, if this deque changed as a result of the call). This method is equivalent to removeFirstOccurrence.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int size()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of elements in this deque.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean contains(Object o)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this deque contains the specified element. More formally, returns true if and only if this deque contains at least one element e such that o.equals(e).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object[] toArray()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque, in proper sequence (from first to last element). The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are maintained by this deque. (In other words, this method must allocate a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array. This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque, in proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If the deque fits in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this deque. If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to null. Like the toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs. Suppose x is a deque known to contain only strings. The following code can be used to dump the deque into a newly allocated array of String:        String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]); Note that toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to toArray().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class: AbstractCollection Returns a string representation of this collection. The string representation consists of a list of the collection's elements in the order they are returned by its iterator, enclosed in square brackets ("[]"). Adjacent elements are separated by the characters ", " (comma and space). Elements are converted to strings as by String.valueOf(Object).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void clear()
				</name>
				<description>
					Atomically removes all of the elements from this deque. The deque will be empty after this call returns.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Iterator<E> iterator()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an iterator over the elements in this deque in proper sequence. The elements will be returned in order from first (head) to last (tail). The returned iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw ConcurrentModificationException, and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Iterator<E> descendingIterator()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an iterator over the elements in this deque in reverse sequential order. The elements will be returned in order from last (tail) to first (head). The returned iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw ConcurrentModificationException, and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.
