		<description>
			This interface represents the current state of the selection for the tree component. For information and examples of using tree selection models, see How to Use Trees in The Java Tutorial. The state of the tree selection is characterized by a set of TreePaths, and optionally a set of integers. The mapping from TreePath to integer is done by way of an instance of RowMapper. It is not necessary for a TreeSelectionModel to have a RowMapper to correctly operate, but without a RowMapper getSelectionRows will return null. A TreeSelectionModel can be configured to allow only one path (SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION) a number of continguous paths (CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION) or a number of discontiguous paths (DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION). A RowMapper is used to determine if TreePaths are contiguous. In the absence of a RowMapper CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION and DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION behave the same, that is they allow any number of paths to be contained in the TreeSelectionModel. For a selection model of CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION any time the paths are changed (setSelectionPath, addSelectionPath ...) the TreePaths are again checked to make they are contiguous. A check of the TreePaths can also be forced by invoking resetRowSelection. How a set of discontiguous TreePaths is mapped to a contiguous set is left to implementors of this interface to enforce a particular policy. Implementations should combine duplicate TreePaths that are added to the selection. For example, the following code      TreePath[] paths = new TreePath[] { treePath, treePath };     treeSelectionModel.setSelectionPaths(paths);   should result in only one path being selected: treePath, and not two copies of treePath. The lead TreePath is the last path that was added (or set). The lead row is then the row that corresponds to the TreePath as determined from the RowMapper.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					static final말nt SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION
				</name>
				<description>
					Selection can only contain one path at a time.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					static final말nt CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION
				</name>
				<description>
					Selection can only be contiguous. This will only be enforced if a RowMapper instance is provided. That is, if no RowMapper is set this behaves the same as DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					static final말nt DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION
				</name>
				<description>
					Selection can contain any number of items that are not necessarily contiguous.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void맙etSelectionMode(int맔ode)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the selection model, which must be one of SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION, CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION or DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION. This may change the selection if the current selection is not valid for the new mode. For example, if three TreePaths are selected when the mode is changed to SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION, only one TreePath will remain selected. It is up to the particular implementation to decide what TreePath remains selected.
