			Class DateTimeAtCreation is a printing attribute class, a date-time attribute, that indicates the date and time at which the Print Job was created. To construct a DateTimeAtCreation attribute from separate values of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, use a Calendar object to construct a Date object, then use the Date object to construct the DateTimeAtCreation attribute. To convert a DateTimeAtCreation attribute to separate values of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, create a Calendar object and set it to the Date from the DateTimeAtCreation attribute. IPP Compatibility: The information needed to construct an IPP "date-time-at-creation" attribute can be obtained as described above. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
