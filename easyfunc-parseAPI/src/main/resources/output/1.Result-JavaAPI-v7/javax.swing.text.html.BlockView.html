			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맙etParent(View맗arent)
				</name>
				<description>
					Establishes the parent view for this view. This is guaranteed to be called before any other methods if the parent view is functioning properly. This is implemented to forward to the superclass as well as call the setPropertiesFromAttributes() method to set the paragraph properties from the css attributes. The call is made at this time to ensure the ability to resolve upward through the parents view attributes.

				</name>
				<description>
					Calculate the requirements of the block along the major axis (i.e. the axis along with it tiles). This is implemented to provide the superclass behavior and then adjust it if the CSS width or height attribute is specified and applicable to the axis.

				</name>
				<description>
					Calculate the requirements of the block along the minor axis (i.e. the axis orthoginal to the axis along with it tiles). This is implemented to provide the superclass behavior and then adjust it if the CSS width or height attribute is specified and applicable to the axis.

				</name>
				<description>
					Performs layout for the minor axis of the box (i.e. the axis orthoginal to the axis that it represents). The results of the layout (the offset and span for each children) are placed in the given arrays which represent the allocations to the children along the minor axis.

					public맜oid맗aint(Graphics많,           Shape마llocation)
				</name>
				<description>
					Renders using the given rendering surface and area on that surface. This is implemented to delegate to the css box painter to paint the border and background prior to the interior.
				</description>

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:View Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed in a location that this view is responsible for. To reduce the burden to subclasses, this functionality is spread out into the following calls that subclasses can reimplement: updateChildren is called if there were any changes to the element this view is responsible for. If this view has child views that are represent the child elements, then this method should do whatever is necessary to make sure the child views correctly represent the model. forwardUpdate is called to forward the DocumentEvent to the appropriate child views. updateLayout is called to give the view a chance to either repair its layout, to reschedule layout, or do nothing.
