			public class DragSourceEvent  extends EventObject
		</name>
		<description>
			This class is the base class for DragSourceDragEvent and DragSourceDropEvent. DragSourceEvents are generated whenever the drag enters, moves over, or exits a drop site, when the drop action changes, and when the drag ends. The location for the generated DragSourceEvent specifies the mouse cursor location in screen coordinates at the moment this event occured. In a multi-screen environment without a virtual device, the cursor location is specified in the coordinate system of the initiator GraphicsConfiguration. The initiator GraphicsConfiguration is the GraphicsConfiguration of the Component on which the drag gesture for the current drag operation was recognized. If the cursor location is outside the bounds of the initiator GraphicsConfiguration, the reported coordinates are clipped to fit within the bounds of that GraphicsConfiguration. In a multi-screen environment with a virtual device, the location is specified in the corresponding virtual coordinate system. If the cursor location is outside the bounds of the virtual device the reported coordinates are clipped to fit within the bounds of the virtual device.
