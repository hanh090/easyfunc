			public abstract class CommandMap  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			The CommandMap class provides an interface to a registry of command objects available in the system. Developers are expected to either use the CommandMap implementation included with this package (MailcapCommandMap) or develop their own. Note that some of the methods in this class are abstract.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicCommandMap()
				</name>
				<description>
					null
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public staticCommandMap많etDefaultCommandMap()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the default CommandMap. In cases where a CommandMap instance has been previously set to some value (via setDefaultCommandMap) return the CommandMap. In cases where no CommandMap has been set, the CommandMap creates an instance of MailcapCommandMap and set that to the default, returning its value.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static맜oid맙etDefaultCommandMap(CommandMap맊ommandMap)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the default CommandMap. Reset the CommandMap to the default by calling this method with null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractCommandInfo[]많etPreferredCommands(String맔imeType)
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the preferred command list from a MIME Type. The actual semantics are determined by the implementation of the CommandMap.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					publicCommandInfo[]많etPreferredCommands(String맔imeType,                                   DataSource맋s)
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the preferred command list from a MIME Type. The actual semantics are determined by the implementation of the CommandMap. The DataSource provides extra information, such as the file name, that a CommandMap implementation may use to further refine the list of commands that are returned. The implementation in this class simply calls the getPreferredCommands method that ignores this argument.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractCommandInfo[]많etAllCommands(String맔imeType)
				</name>
				<description>
					Get all the available commands for this type. This method should return all the possible commands for this MIME type.
				</description>

				<name>
					publicCommandInfo[]많etAllCommands(String맔imeType,                             DataSource맋s)
				</name>
				<description>
					Get all the available commands for this type. This method should return all the possible commands for this MIME type. The DataSource provides extra information, such as the file name, that a CommandMap implementation may use to further refine the list of commands that are returned. The implementation in this class simply calls the getAllCommands method that ignores this argument.

				<name>
					public abstractCommandInfo많etCommand(String맔imeType,                       String맊mdName)
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the default command corresponding to the MIME type.

				</name>
				<description>
					Get the default command corresponding to the MIME type. The DataSource provides extra information, such as the file name, that a CommandMap implementation may use to further refine the command that is chosen. The implementation in this class simply calls the getCommand method that ignores this argument.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractDataContentHandler맊reateDataContentHandler(String맔imeType)
				</name>
				<description>
					Locate a DataContentHandler that corresponds to the MIME type. The mechanism and semantics for determining this are determined by the implementation of the particular CommandMap.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					publicString[]많etMimeTypes()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get all the MIME types known to this command map. If the command map doesn't support this operation, null is returned.
