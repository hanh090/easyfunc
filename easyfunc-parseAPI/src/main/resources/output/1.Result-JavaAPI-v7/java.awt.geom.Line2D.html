			public abstract class Line2D  extends Object  implements Shape, Cloneable
		</name>
		<description>
			This Line2D represents a line segment in (x,y) coordinate space. This class, like all of the Java 2D API, uses a default coordinate system called user space in which the y-axis values increase downward and x-axis values increase to the right. For more information on the user space coordinate system, see the Coordinate Systems section of the Java 2D Programmer's Guide. This class is only the abstract superclass for all objects that store a 2D line segment. The actual storage representation of the coordinates is left to the subclass.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an indicator of where the specified point (px,py) lies with respect to the line segment from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). The return value can be either 1, -1, or 0 and indicates in which direction the specified line must pivot around its first end point, (x1,y1), in order to point at the specified point (px,py). A return value of 1 indicates that the line segment must turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards the negative Y axis. In the default coordinate system used by Java 2D, this direction is counterclockwise. A return value of -1 indicates that the line segment must turn in the direction that takes the positive X axis towards the positive Y axis. In the default coordinate system, this direction is clockwise. A return value of 0 indicates that the point lies exactly on the line segment. Note that an indicator value of 0 is rare and not useful for determining colinearity because of floating point rounding issues. If the point is colinear with the line segment, but not between the end points, then the value will be -1 if the point lies "beyond (x1,y1)" or 1 if the point lies "beyond (x2,y2)".

				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape intersects the interior of a specified rectangular area. The rectangular area is considered to intersect the Shape if any point is contained in both the interior of the Shape and the specified rectangular area. The Shape.intersects() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return true when: there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the Shape intersect, but the calculations to accurately determine this intersection are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return true even though the rectangular area does not intersect the Shape. The Area class performs more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.

					publicRectangle많etBounds()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an integer Rectangle that completely encloses the Shape. Note that there is no guarantee that the returned Rectangle is the smallest bounding box that encloses the Shape, only that the Shape lies entirely within the indicated Rectangle. The returned Rectangle might also fail to completely enclose the Shape if the Shape overflows the limited range of the integer data type. The getBounds2D method generally returns a tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in representation. Note that the definition of insideness can lead to situations where points on the defining outline of the shape may not be considered contained in the returned bounds object, but only in cases where those points are also not considered contained in the original shape. If a point is inside the shape according to the contains(point) method, then it must be inside the returned Rectangle bounds object according to the contains(point) method of the bounds. Specifically: shape.contains(x,y) requires bounds.contains(x,y) If a point is not inside the shape, then it might still be contained in the bounds object: bounds.contains(x,y) does not imply shape.contains(x,y)
