		<description>
			Activation makes use of special identifiers to denote remote objects that can be activated over time. An activation identifier (an instance of the class ActivationID) contains several pieces of information needed for activating an object: a remote reference to the object's activator (a RemoteRef instance), and a unique identifier (a UID instance) for the object. An activation identifier for an object can be obtained by registering an object with the activation system. Registration is accomplished in a few ways: via the Activatable.register method via the first Activatable constructor (that takes three arguments and both registers and exports the object, and via the first Activatable.exportObject method that takes the activation descriptor, object and port as arguments; this method both registers and exports the object.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicㅁctivationID(Activator마ctivator)
				</name>
				<description>
					The constructor for ActivationID takes a single argument, activator, that specifies a remote reference to the activator responsible for activating the object associated with this identifier. An instance of ActivationID is globally unique.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicRemote마ctivate(boolean맍orce)                  throws ActivationException,                         UnknownObjectException,                         RemoteException
				</name>
				<description>
					Activate the object for this id.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt맏ashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a hashcode for the activation id. Two identifiers that refer to the same remote object will have the same hash code.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean만quals(Object맖bj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares two activation ids for content equality. Returns true if both of the following conditions are true: 1) the unique identifiers equivalent (by content), and 2) the activator specified in each identifier refers to the same remote object.
