		<description>
			The AffineTransform class represents a 2D affine transform that performs a linear mapping from 2D coordinates to other 2D coordinates that preserves the "straightness" and "parallelness" of lines. Affine transformations can be constructed using sequences of translations, scales, flips, rotations, and shears. Such a coordinate transformation can be represented by a 3 row by 3 column matrix with an implied last row of [ 0 0 1 ]. This matrix transforms source coordinates (x,y) into destination coordinates (x',y') by considering them to be a column vector and multiplying the coordinate vector by the matrix according to the following process:         [ x']   [  m00  m01  m02  ] [ x ]   [ m00x + m01y + m02 ]        [ y'] = [  m10  m11  m12  ] [ y ] = [ m10x + m11y + m12 ]        [ 1 ]   [   0    0    1   ] [ 1 ]   [         1         ]   Handling 90-Degree Rotations In some variations of the rotate methods in the AffineTransform class, a double-precision argument specifies the angle of rotation in radians. These methods have special handling for rotations of approximately 90 degrees (including multiples such as 180, 270, and 360 degrees), so that the common case of quadrant rotation is handled more efficiently. This special handling can cause angles very close to multiples of 90 degrees to be treated as if they were exact multiples of 90 degrees. For small multiples of 90 degrees the range of angles treated as a quadrant rotation is approximately 0.00000121 degrees wide. This section explains why such special care is needed and how it is implemented. Since 90 degrees is represented as PI/2 in radians, and since PI is a transcendental (and therefore irrational) number, it is not possible to exactly represent a multiple of 90 degrees as an exact double precision value measured in radians. As a result it is theoretically impossible to describe quadrant rotations (90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees) using these values. Double precision floating point values can get very close to non-zero multiples of PI/2 but never close enough for the sine or cosine to be exactly 0.0, 1.0 or -1.0. The implementations of Math.sin() and Math.cos() correspondingly never return 0.0 for any case other than Math.sin(0.0). These same implementations do, however, return exactly 1.0 and -1.0 for some range of numbers around each multiple of 90 degrees since the correct answer is so close to 1.0 or -1.0 that the double precision significand cannot represent the difference as accurately as it can for numbers that are near 0.0. The net result of these issues is that if the Math.sin() and Math.cos() methods are used to directly generate the values for the matrix modifications during these radian-based rotation operations then the resulting transform is never strictly classifiable as a quadrant rotation even for a simple case like rotate(Math.PI/2.0), due to minor variations in the matrix caused by the non-0.0 values obtained for the sine and cosine. If these transforms are not classified as quadrant rotations then subsequent code which attempts to optimize further operations based upon the type of the transform will be relegated to its most general implementation. Because quadrant rotations are fairly common, this class should handle these cases reasonably quickly, both in applying the rotations to the transform and in applying the resulting transform to the coordinates. To facilitate this optimal handling, the methods which take an angle of rotation measured in radians attempt to detect angles that are intended to be quadrant rotations and treat them as such. These methods therefore treat an angle theta as a quadrant rotation if either Math.sin(theta) or Math.cos(theta) returns exactly 1.0 or -1.0. As a rule of thumb, this property holds true for a range of approximately 0.0000000211 radians (or 0.00000121 degrees) around small multiples of Math.PI/2.0.

				</name>
				<description>
					This flag bit indicates that the transform defined by this object performs a mirror image flip about some axis which changes the normally right handed coordinate system into a left handed system in addition to the conversions indicated by other flag bits. A right handed coordinate system is one where the positive X axis rotates counterclockwise to overlay the positive Y axis similar to the direction that the fingers on your right hand curl when you stare end on at your thumb. A left handed coordinate system is one where the positive X axis rotates clockwise to overlay the positive Y axis similar to the direction that the fingers on your left hand curl. There is no mathematical way to determine the angle of the original flipping or mirroring transformation since all angles of flip are identical given an appropriate adjusting rotation.

A valid combination of flag bits is an exclusive OR operation that can combine the TYPE_TRANSLATION flag bit in addition to either of the TYPE_UNIFORM_SCALE or TYPE_GENERAL_SCALE flag bits as well as either of the TYPE_QUADRANT_ROTATION or TYPE_GENERAL_ROTATION flag bits.

			<method>
				<name>
					public double getDeterminant()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the determinant of the matrix representation of the transform. The determinant is useful both to determine if the transform can be inverted and to get a single value representing the combined X and Y scaling of the transform. If the determinant is non-zero, then this transform is invertible and the various methods that depend on the inverse transform do not need to throw a NoninvertibleTransformException. If the determinant is zero then this transform can not be inverted since the transform maps all input coordinates onto a line or a point. If the determinant is near enough to zero then inverse transform operations might not carry enough precision to produce meaningful results. If this transform represents a uniform scale, as indicated by the getType method then the determinant also represents the square of the uniform scale factor by which all of the points are expanded from or contracted towards the origin. If this transform represents a non-uniform scale or more general transform then the determinant is not likely to represent a value useful for any purpose other than determining if inverse transforms are possible. Mathematically, the determinant is calculated using the formula:             |  m00  m01  m02  |            |  m10  m11  m12  |  =  m00 * m11 - m01 * m10            |   0    0    1   |

					Returns an AffineTransform object representing the inverse transformation. The inverse transform Tx' of this transform Tx maps coordinates transformed by Tx back to their original coordinates. In other words, Tx'(Tx(p)) = p = Tx(Tx'(p)). If this transform maps all coordinates onto a point or a line then it will not have an inverse, since coordinates that do not lie on the destination point or line will not have an inverse mapping. The getDeterminant method can be used to determine if this transform has no inverse, in which case an exception will be thrown if the createInverse method is called.

				</name>
				<description>
					Transforms an array of point objects by this transform. If any element of the ptDst array is null, a new Point2D object is allocated and stored into that element before storing the results of the transformation. Note that this method does not take any precautions to avoid problems caused by storing results into Point2D objects that will be used as the source for calculations further down the source array. This method does guarantee that if a specified Point2D object is both the source and destination for the same single point transform operation then the results will not be stored until the calculations are complete to avoid storing the results on top of the operands. If, however, the destination Point2D object for one operation is the same object as the source Point2D object for another operation further down the source array then the original coordinates in that point are overwritten before they can be converted.
