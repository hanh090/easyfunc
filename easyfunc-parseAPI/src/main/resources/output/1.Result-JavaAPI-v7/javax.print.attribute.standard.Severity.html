		<description>
			Class Severity is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that denotes the severity of a PrinterStateReason attribute. Instances of Severity do not appear in a Print Service's attribute set directly. Rather, a PrinterStateReasons attribute appears in the Print Service's attribute set. The PrinterStateReasons attribute contains zero, one, or more than one PrinterStateReason objects which pertain to the Print Service's status, and each PrinterStateReason object is associated with a Severity level of REPORT (least severe), WARNING, or ERROR (most severe). The printer adds a PrinterStateReason object to the Print Service's PrinterStateReasons attribute when the corresponding condition becomes true of the printer, and the printer removes the PrinterStateReason object again when the corresponding condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Service's overall PrinterState also changed. IPP Compatibility: Severity.toString() returns either "error", "warning", or "report". The string values returned by each individual PrinterStateReason and associated Severity object's toString() methods, concatenated together with a hyphen ("-") in between, gives the IPP keyword value for a PrinterStateReasons. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalSeverity REPORT
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates that the PrinterStateReason is a "report" (least severe). An implementation may choose to omit some or all reports. Some reports specify finer granularity about the printer state; others serve as a precursor to a warning. A report must contain nothing that could affect the printed output.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalSeverity WARNING
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates that the PrinterStateReason is a "warning." An implementation may choose to omit some or all warnings. Warnings serve as a precursor to an error. A warning must contain nothing that prevents a job from completing, though in some cases the output may be of lower quality.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalSeverity ERROR
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates that the PrinterStateReason is an "error" (most severe). An implementation must include all errors. If this attribute contains one or more errors, the printer's PrinterState must be STOPPED.

			<method>
				<name>
					public finalClass<? extends Attribute>많etCategory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the "category" for this printing attribute value. For class Severity, the category is class Severity itself.

					public finalString많etName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the name of the category of which this attribute value is an instance. For class Severit, the category name is "severity".
