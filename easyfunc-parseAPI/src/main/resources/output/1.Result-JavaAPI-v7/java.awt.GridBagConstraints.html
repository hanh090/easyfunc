				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>

				<description>
					Specifies the number of cells in a row for the component's display area. Use REMAINDER to specify that the component's display area will be from gridx to the last cell in the row.

					Specifies the number of cells in a column for the component's display area. Use REMAINDER to specify that the component's display area will be from gridy to the last cell in the column. Use RELATIVE to specify that the component's display area will be from gridy to the next to the last one in its column. gridheight should be a non-negative value and the default value is 1.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맋ouble weightx
				</name>
				<description>
					Specifies how to distribute extra horizontal space. The grid bag layout manager calculates the weight of a column to be the maximum weightx of all the components in a column. If the resulting layout is smaller horizontally than the area it needs to fill, the extra space is distributed to each column in proportion to its weight. A column that has a weight of zero receives no extra space. If all the weights are zero, all the extra space appears between the grids of the cell and the left and right edges. The default value of this field is 0. weightx should be a non-negative value.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맋ouble weighty
				</name>
				<description>
					Specifies how to distribute extra vertical space. The grid bag layout manager calculates the weight of a row to be the maximum weighty of all the components in a row. If the resulting layout is smaller vertically than the area it needs to fill, the extra space is distributed to each row in proportion to its weight. A row that has a weight of zero receives no extra space. If all the weights are zero, all the extra space appears between the grids of the cell and the top and bottom edges. The default value of this field is 0. weighty should be a non-negative value.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt anchor
				</name>
				<description>
					This field is used when the component is smaller than its display area. It determines where, within the display area, to place the component. There are three kinds of possible values: orientation relative, baseline relative and absolute. Orientation relative values are interpreted relative to the container's component orientation property, baseline relative values are interpreted relative to the baseline and absolute values are not. The absolute values are: CENTER, NORTH, NORTHEAST, EAST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTH, SOUTHWEST, WEST, and NORTHWEST. The orientation relative values are: PAGE_START, PAGE_END, LINE_START, LINE_END, FIRST_LINE_START, FIRST_LINE_END, LAST_LINE_START and LAST_LINE_END. The baseline relative values are: BASELINE, BASELINE_LEADING, BASELINE_TRAILING, ABOVE_BASELINE, ABOVE_BASELINE_LEADING, ABOVE_BASELINE_TRAILING, BELOW_BASELINE, BELOW_BASELINE_LEADING, and BELOW_BASELINE_TRAILING. The default value is CENTER.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt fill
				</name>
				<description>
					This field is used when the component's display area is larger than the component's requested size. It determines whether to resize the component, and if so, how. The following values are valid for fill: NONE: Do not resize the component. HORIZONTAL: Make the component wide enough to fill its display area horizontally, but do not change its height. VERTICAL: Make the component tall enough to fill its display area vertically, but do not change its width. BOTH: Make the component fill its display area entirely. The default value is NONE.

			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt ipadx
				</name>

				<name>
					public말nt ipady
				</name>
				<description>

				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a GridBagConstraints object with all of its fields set to the passed-in arguments. Note: Because the use of this constructor hinders readability of source code, this constructor should only be used by automatic source code generation tools.
