		</name>
		<description>
			A RelationTypeSupport object implements the RelationType interface. It represents a relation type, providing role information for each role expected to be supported in every relation of that type. A relation type includes a relation type name and a list of role infos (represented by RoleInfo objects). A relation type has to be declared in the Relation Service: - either using the createRelationType() method, where a RelationTypeSupport object will be created and kept in the Relation Service - either using the addRelationType() method where the user has to create an object implementing the RelationType interface, and this object will be used as representing a relation type in the Relation Service. The serialVersionUID of this class is 4611072955724144607L.

				<description>
					Add a role info. This method of course should not be used after the creation of the relation type, because updating it would invalidate that the relations created associated to that type still conform to it. Can throw a RuntimeException if trying to update a relation type declared in the Relation Service.
