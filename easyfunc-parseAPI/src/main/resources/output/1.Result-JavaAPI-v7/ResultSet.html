		<description>
			A table of data representing a database result set, which is usually generated by executing a statement that queries the database. A ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data. Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next method moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there are no more rows in the ResultSet object, it can be used in a while loop to iterate through the result set. A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the first row to the last row. It is possible to produce ResultSet objects that are scrollable and/or updatable. The following code fragment, in which con is a valid Connection object, illustrates how to make a result set that is scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and that is updatable. See ResultSet fields for other options.            Statement stmt = con.createStatement(                                        ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE,                                        ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);         ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2");         // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others,         // and will be updatable     The ResultSet interface provides getter methods (getBoolean, getLong, and so on) for retrieving column values from the current row. Values can be retrieved using either the index number of the column or the name of the column. In general, using the column index will be more efficient. Columns are numbered from 1. For maximum portability, result set columns within each row should be read in left-to-right order, and each column should be read only once. For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts to convert the underlying data to the Java type specified in the getter method and returns a suitable Java value. The JDBC specification has a table showing the allowable mappings from SQL types to Java types that can be used by the ResultSet getter methods. Column names used as input to getter methods are case insensitive. When a getter method is called with a column name and several columns have the same name, the value of the first matching column will be returned. The column name option is designed to be used when column names are used in the SQL query that generated the result set. For columns that are NOT explicitly named in the query, it is best to use column numbers. If column names are used, the programmer should take care to guarantee that they uniquely refer to the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL AS clause. A set of updater methods were added to this interface in the JDBC 2.0 API (JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding parameters to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the updater methods. The updater methods may be used in two ways: to update a column value in the current row. In a scrollable ResultSet object, the cursor can be moved backwards and forwards, to an absolute position, or to a position relative to the current row. The following code fragment updates the NAME column in the fifth row of the ResultSet object rs and then uses the method updateRow to update the data source table from which rs was derived.            rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs         rs.updateString("NAME", "AINSWORTH"); // updates the            // NAME column of row 5 to be AINSWORTH         rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source     to insert column values into the insert row. An updatable ResultSet object has a special row associated with it that serves as a staging area for building a row to be inserted. The following code fragment moves the cursor to the insert row, builds a three-column row, and inserts it into rs and into the data source table using the method insertRow.            rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row         rs.updateString(1, "AINSWORTH"); // updates the            // first column of the insert row to be AINSWORTH         rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be 35         rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to true         rs.insertRow();         rs.moveToCurrentRow();     A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results. The number, types and properties of a ResultSet object's columns are provided by the ResultSetMetaData object returned by the ResultSet.getMetaData method.

					boolean next()               throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the cursor froward one row from its current position. A ResultSet cursor is initially positioned before the first row; the first call to the method next makes the first row the current row; the second call makes the second row the current row, and so on. When a call to the next method returns false, the cursor is positioned after the last row. Any invocation of a ResultSet method which requires a current row will result in a SQLException being thrown. If the result set type is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, it is vendor specified whether their JDBC driver implementation will return false or throw an SQLException on a subsequent call to next. If an input stream is open for the current row, a call to the method next will implicitly close it. A ResultSet object's warning chain is cleared when a new row is read.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void close()             throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Releases this ResultSet object's database and JDBC resources immediately instead of waiting for this to happen when it is automatically closed. The closing of a ResultSet object does not close the Blob, Clob or NClob objects created by the ResultSet. Blob, Clob or NClob objects remain valid for at least the duration of the transaction in which they are creataed, unless their free method is invoked. When a ResultSet is closed, any ResultSetMetaData instances that were created by calling the getMetaData method remain accessible. Note: A ResultSet object is automatically closed by the Statement object that generated it when that Statement object is closed, re-executed, or is used to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results. Calling the method close on a ResultSet object that is already closed is a no-op.

				<description>
					Retrieves the name of the SQL cursor used by this ResultSet object. In SQL, a result table is retrieved through a cursor that is named. The current row of a result set can be updated or deleted using a positioned update/delete statement that references the cursor name. To insure that the cursor has the proper isolation level to support update, the cursor's SELECT statement should be of the form SELECT FOR UPDATE. If FOR UPDATE is omitted, the positioned updates may fail. The JDBC API supports this SQL feature by providing the name of the SQL cursor used by a ResultSet object. The current row of a ResultSet object is also the current row of this SQL cursor.

					Object getObject(int columnIndex)                   throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the value of the designated column in the current row of this ResultSet object as an Object in the Java programming language. This method will return the value of the given column as a Java object. The type of the Java object will be the default Java object type corresponding to the column's SQL type, following the mapping for built-in types specified in the JDBC specification. If the value is an SQL NULL, the driver returns a Java null. This method may also be used to read database-specific abstract data types. In the JDBC 2.0 API, the behavior of method getObject is extended to materialize data of SQL user-defined types. If Connection.getTypeMap does not throw a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException, then when a column contains a structured or distinct value, the behavior of this method is as if it were a call to: getObject(columnIndex, this.getStatement().getConnection().getTypeMap()). If Connection.getTypeMap does throw a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException, then structured values are not supported, and distinct values are mapped to the default Java class as determined by the underlying SQL type of the DISTINCT type.

					boolean absolute(int row)                   throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the cursor to the given row number in this ResultSet object. If the row number is positive, the cursor moves to the given row number with respect to the beginning of the result set. The first row is row 1, the second is row 2, and so on. If the given row number is negative, the cursor moves to an absolute row position with respect to the end of the result set. For example, calling the method absolute(-1) positions the cursor on the last row; calling the method absolute(-2) moves the cursor to the next-to-last row, and so on. If the row number specified is zero, the cursor is moved to before the first row. An attempt to position the cursor beyond the first/last row in the result set leaves the cursor before the first row or after the last row. Note: Calling absolute(1) is the same as calling first(). Calling absolute(-1) is the same as calling last().

				<name>
					boolean relative(int rows)                   throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the cursor a relative number of rows, either positive or negative. Attempting to move beyond the first/last row in the result set positions the cursor before/after the the first/last row. Calling relative(0) is valid, but does not change the cursor position. Note: Calling the method relative(1) is identical to calling the method next() and calling the method relative(-1) is identical to calling the method previous().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean previous()                   throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the cursor to the previous row in this ResultSet object. When a call to the previous method returns false, the cursor is positioned before the first row. Any invocation of a ResultSet method which requires a current row will result in a SQLException being thrown. If an input stream is open for the current row, a call to the method previous will implicitly close it. A ResultSet object's warning change is cleared when a new row is read.

					void refreshRow()                  throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Refreshes the current row with its most recent value in the database. This method cannot be called when the cursor is on the insert row. The refreshRow method provides a way for an application to explicitly tell the JDBC driver to refetch a row(s) from the database. An application may want to call refreshRow when caching or prefetching is being done by the JDBC driver to fetch the latest value of a row from the database. The JDBC driver may actually refresh multiple rows at once if the fetch size is greater than one. All values are refetched subject to the transaction isolation level and cursor sensitivity. If refreshRow is called after calling an updater method, but before calling the method updateRow, then the updates made to the row are lost. Calling the method refreshRow frequently will likely slow performance.

				<description>
					Moves the cursor to the insert row. The current cursor position is remembered while the cursor is positioned on the insert row. The insert row is a special row associated with an updatable result set. It is essentially a buffer where a new row may be constructed by calling the updater methods prior to inserting the row into the result set. Only the updater, getter, and insertRow methods may be called when the cursor is on the insert row. All of the columns in a result set must be given a value each time this method is called before calling insertRow. An updater method must be called before a getter method can be called on a column value.

The driver does the necessary conversion from Java character format to the national character set in the database. It is intended for use when updating NCHAR,NVARCHAR and LONGNVARCHAR columns. The updater methods are used to update column values in the current row or the insert row. The updater methods do not update the underlying database; instead the updateRow or insertRow methods are called to update the database.
