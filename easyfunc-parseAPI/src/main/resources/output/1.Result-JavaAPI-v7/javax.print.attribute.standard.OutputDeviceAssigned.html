		<description>
			Class OutputDeviceAssigned is a printing attribute class, a text attribute, that identifies the output device to which the service has assigned this job. If an output device implements an embedded Print Service instance, the printer need not set this attribute. If a print server implements a Print Service instance, the value may be empty (zero- length string) or not returned until the service assigns an output device to the job. This attribute is particularly useful when a single service supports multiple devices (so called "fan-out"). IPP Compatibility: The string value gives the IPP name value. The locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
