		</name>
		<description>
			A pool of styles and their associated resources. This class determines the lifetime of a group of resources by being a container that holds caches for various resources such as font and color that get reused by the various style definitions. This can be shared by multiple documents if desired to maximize the sharing of related resources. This class also provides efficient support for small sets of attributes and compresses them by sharing across uses and taking advantage of their immutable nature. Since many styles are replicated, the potential for sharing is significant, and copies can be extremely cheap. Larger sets reduce the possibility of sharing, and therefore revert automatically to a less space-efficient implementation. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

				</name>
				<description>
					Writes a set of attributes to the given object stream for the purpose of serialization. This will take special care to deal with static attribute keys that have been registered wit the registerStaticAttributeKey method. Any attribute key not regsitered as a static key will be serialized directly. All values are expected to be serializable.

					public static맜oidreadAttributeSet(ObjectInputStream말n,                      MutableAttributeSet마)                               throws ClassNotFoundException,                                      IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads a set of attributes from the given object input stream that have been previously written out with writeAttributeSet. This will try to restore keys that were static objects to the static objects in the current virtual machine considering only those keys that have been registered with the registerStaticAttributeKey method. The attributes retrieved from the stream will be placed into the given mutable set.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static맜oidregisterStaticAttributeKey(Object맒ey)
				</name>
				<description>
					Registers an object as a static object that is being used as a key in attribute sets. This allows the key to be treated specially for serialization. For operation under a 1.1 virtual machine, this uses the value returned by toString concatenated to the classname. The value returned by toString should not have the class reference in it (ie it should be reimplemented from the definition in Object) in order to be the same when recomputed later.
