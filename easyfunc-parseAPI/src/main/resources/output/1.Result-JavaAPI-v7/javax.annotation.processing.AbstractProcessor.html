			public abstract class AbstractProcessor  extends Object  implements Processor
		</name>
		<description>
			An abstract annotation processor designed to be a convenient superclass for most concrete annotation processors. This class examines annotation values to compute the options, annotations, and source version supported by its subtypes. The getter methods may issue warnings about noteworthy conditions using the facilities available after the processor has been initialized. Subclasses are free to override the implementation and specification of any of the methods in this class as long as the general Processor contract for that method is obeyed.

				<description>
					If the processor class is annotated with SupportedOptions, return an unmodifiable set with the same set of strings as the annotation. If the class is not so annotated, an empty set is returned.

				<description>
					If the processor class is annotated with SupportedAnnotationTypes, return an unmodifiable set with the same set of strings as the annotation. If the class is not so annotated, an empty set is returned.

				<description>
					If the processor class is annotated with SupportedSourceVersion, return the source version in the annotation. If the class is not so annotated, SourceVersion.RELEASE_6 is returned.

					public맜oid말nit(ProcessingEnvironment맗rocessingEnv)
				</name>
				<description>
					Initializes the processor with the processing environment by setting the processingEnv field to the value of the processingEnv argument. An IllegalStateException will be thrown if this method is called more than once on the same object.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract막oolean맗rocess(Set<? extends TypeElement>마nnotations,                RoundEnvironmentroundEnv)
				</name>
				<description>
					Processes a set of annotation types on type elements originating from the prior round and returns whether or not these annotations are claimed by this processor. If true is returned, the annotations are claimed and subsequent processors will not be asked to process them; if false is returned, the annotations are unclaimed and subsequent processors may be asked to process them. A processor may always return the same boolean value or may vary the result based on chosen criteria. The input set will be empty if the processor supports "*" and the root elements have no annotations. A Processor must gracefully handle an empty set of annotations.
