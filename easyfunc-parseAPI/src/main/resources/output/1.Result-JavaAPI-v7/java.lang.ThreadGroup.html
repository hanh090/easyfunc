		<description>
			A thread group represents a set of threads. In addition, a thread group can also include other thread groups. The thread groups form a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group has a parent. A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread group, but not to access information about its thread group's parent thread group or any other thread groups.

				<name>
					publicThreadGroup(String맕ame)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new thread group. The parent of this new group is the thread group of the currently running thread. The checkAccess method of the parent thread group is called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public finalThreadGroup많etParent()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the parent of this thread group. First, if the parent is not null, the checkAccess method of the parent thread group is called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public final말nt많etMaxPriority()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the maximum priority of this thread group. Threads that are part of this group cannot have a higher priority than the maximum priority.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final막oolean말sDaemon()
				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if this thread group is a daemon thread group. A daemon thread group is automatically destroyed when its last thread is stopped or its last thread group is destroyed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sDestroyed()
				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if this thread group has been destroyed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final맜oid맙etDaemon(boolean맋aemon)
				</name>
				<description>
					Changes the daemon status of this thread group. First, the checkAccess method of this thread group is called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception. A daemon thread group is automatically destroyed when its last thread is stopped or its last thread group is destroyed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final맜oid맙etMaxPriority(int맗ri)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the maximum priority of the group. Threads in the thread group that already have a higher priority are not affected. First, the checkAccess method of this thread group is called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception. If the pri argument is less than Thread.MIN_PRIORITY or greater than Thread.MAX_PRIORITY, the maximum priority of the group remains unchanged. Otherwise, the priority of this ThreadGroup object is set to the smaller of the specified pri and the maximum permitted priority of the parent of this thread group. (If this thread group is the system thread group, which has no parent, then its maximum priority is simply set to pri.) Then this method is called recursively, with pri as its argument, for every thread group that belongs to this thread group.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final막oolean맗arentOf(ThreadGroup많)
				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if this thread group is either the thread group argument or one of its ancestor thread groups.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final맜oid맊heckAccess()
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines if the currently running thread has permission to modify this thread group. If there is a security manager, its checkAccess method is called with this thread group as its argument. This may result in throwing a SecurityException.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt마ctiveCount()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an estimate of the number of active threads in this thread group and its subgroups. Recursively iterates over all subgroups in this thread group. The value returned is only an estimate because the number of threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal data structures, and might be affected by the presence of certain system threads. This method is intended primarily for debugging and monitoring purposes.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt만numerate(Thread[]맓ist)
				</name>
				<description>
					Copies into the specified array every active thread in this thread group and its subgroups. An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation enumerate(list, true)
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt만numerate(Thread[]맓ist,              booleanrecurse)
				</name>
				<description>
					Copies into the specified array every active thread in this thread group. If recurse is true, this method recursively enumerates all subgroups of this thread group and references to every active thread in these subgroups are also included. If the array is too short to hold all the threads, the extra threads are silently ignored. An application might use the activeCount method to get an estimate of how big the array should be, however if the array is too short to hold all the threads, the extra threads are silently ignored. If it is critical to obtain every active thread in this thread group, the caller should verify that the returned int value is strictly less than the length of list. Due to the inherent race condition in this method, it is recommended that the method only be used for debugging and monitoring purposes.

					@Deprecated  public final맜oid맙uspend()
				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated.This method is inherently deadlock-prone. See Thread.suspend() for details. Suspends all threads in this thread group. First, the checkAccess method of this thread group is called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception. This method then calls the suspend method on all the threads in this thread group and in all of its subgroups.
				</description>

					@Deprecated  public final맜oidresume()
				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated.This method is used solely in conjunction with Thread.suspend and ThreadGroup.suspend, both of which have been deprecated, as they are inherently deadlock-prone. See Thread.suspend() for details. Resumes all threads in this thread group. First, the checkAccess method of this thread group is called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception. This method then calls the resume method on all the threads in this thread group and in all of its sub groups.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final맜oid맋estroy()
				</name>
				<description>
					Destroys this thread group and all of its subgroups. This thread group must be empty, indicating that all threads that had been in this thread group have since stopped. First, the checkAccess method of this thread group is called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맛ncaughtException(Thread맚,                       Throwable만)
				</name>
				<description>
					Called by the Java Virtual Machine when a thread in this thread group stops because of an uncaught exception, and the thread does not have a specific Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler installed. The uncaughtException method of ThreadGroup does the following: If this thread group has a parent thread group, the uncaughtException method of that parent is called with the same two arguments. Otherwise, this method checks to see if there is a default uncaught exception handler installed, and if so, its uncaughtException method is called with the same two arguments. Otherwise, this method determines if the Throwable argument is an instance of ThreadDeath. If so, nothing special is done. Otherwise, a message containing the thread's name, as returned from the thread's getName method, and a stack backtrace, using the Throwable's printStackTrace method, is printed to the standard error stream. Applications can override this method in subclasses of ThreadGroup to provide alternative handling of uncaught exceptions.
