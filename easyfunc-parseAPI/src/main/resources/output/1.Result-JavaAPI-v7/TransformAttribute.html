		<description>
			The TransformAttribute class provides an immutable wrapper for a transform so that it is safe to use as an attribute.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalTransformAttribute IDENTITY
				</name>
				<description>
					A TransformAttribute representing the identity transform.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					publicTransformAttribute(AffineTransform맚ransform)
				</name>
				<description>
					Wraps the specified transform. The transform is cloned and a reference to the clone is kept. The original transform is unchanged. If null is passed as the argument, this constructor behaves as though it were the identity transform. (Note that it is preferable to use IDENTITY in this case.)

					Returns a copy of the wrapped transform.

					Returns true if the wrapped transform is an identity transform.

				<description>
					Description copied from class:Object Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by HashMap. The general contract of hashCode is: Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application. If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the Object.equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables. As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer, but this implementation technique is not required by the JavaTM programming language.)
