			public class DropTargetDragEvent  extends DropTargetEvent
		</name>
		<description>
			The DropTargetDragEvent is delivered to a DropTargetListener via its dragEnter() and dragOver() methods. The DropTargetDragEvent reports the source drop actions and the user drop action that reflect the current state of the drag operation. Source drop actions is a bitwise mask of DnDConstants that represents the set of drop actions supported by the drag source for this drag operation. User drop action depends on the drop actions supported by the drag source and the drop action selected by the user. The user can select a drop action by pressing modifier keys during the drag operation:      Ctrl + Shift -> ACTION_LINK     Ctrl         -> ACTION_COPY     Shift        -> ACTION_MOVE   If the user selects a drop action, the user drop action is one of DnDConstants that represents the selected drop action if this drop action is supported by the drag source or DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE if this drop action is not supported by the drag source. If the user doesn't select a drop action, the set of DnDConstants that represents the set of drop actions supported by the drag source is searched for DnDConstants.ACTION_MOVE, then for DnDConstants.ACTION_COPY, then for DnDConstants.ACTION_LINK and the user drop action is the first constant found. If no constant is found the user drop action is DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE.
