		</name>
		<description>
			A URL Connection to a Java ARchive (JAR) file or an entry in a JAR file. The syntax of a JAR URL is:    jar:<url>!/{entry}   for example: jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/baz.jar!/COM/foo/Quux.class Jar URLs should be used to refer to a JAR file or entries in a JAR file. The example above is a JAR URL which refers to a JAR entry. If the entry name is omitted, the URL refers to the whole JAR file: jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/baz.jar!/ Users should cast the generic URLConnection to a JarURLConnection when they know that the URL they created is a JAR URL, and they need JAR-specific functionality. For example:    URL url = new URL("jar:file:/home/duke/duke.jar!/");   JarURLConnection jarConnection = (JarURLConnection)url.openConnection();   Manifest manifest = jarConnection.getManifest();   JarURLConnection instances can only be used to read from JAR files. It is not possible to get a OutputStream to modify or write to the underlying JAR file using this class. Examples: A Jar entry jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/baz.jar!/COM/foo/Quux.class A Jar file jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/baz.jar!/ A Jar directory jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/baz.jar!/COM/foo/ !/ is refered to as the separator. When constructing a JAR url via new URL(context, spec), the following rules apply: if there is no context URL and the specification passed to the URL constructor doesn't contain a separator, the URL is considered to refer to a JarFile. if there is a context URL, the context URL is assumed to refer to a JAR file or a Jar directory. if the specification begins with a '/', the Jar directory is ignored, and the spec is considered to be at the root of the Jar file. Examples: context: jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/jar.jar!/, spec:baz/entry.txt url:jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/jar.jar!/baz/entry.txt context: jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/jar.jar!/baz, spec:entry.txt url:jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/jar.jar!/baz/entry.txt context: jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/jar.jar!/baz, spec:/entry.txt url:jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/jar.jar!/entry.txt
