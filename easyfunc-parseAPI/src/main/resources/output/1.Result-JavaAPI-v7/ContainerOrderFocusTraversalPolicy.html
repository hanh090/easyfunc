			public class ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy  extends FocusTraversalPolicy  implements Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			A FocusTraversalPolicy that determines traversal order based on the order of child Components in a Container. From a particular focus cycle root, the policy makes a pre-order traversal of the Component hierarchy, and traverses a Container's children according to the ordering of the array returned by Container.getComponents(). Portions of the hierarchy that are not visible and displayable will not be searched. By default, ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy implicitly transfers focus down-cycle. That is, during normal forward focus traversal, the Component traversed after a focus cycle root will be the focus-cycle-root's default Component to focus. This behavior can be disabled using the setImplicitDownCycleTraversal method. By default, methods of this class with return a Component only if it is visible, displayable, enabled, and focusable. Subclasses can modify this behavior by overriding the accept method. This policy takes into account focus traversal policy providers. When searching for first/last/next/previous Component, if a focus traversal policy provider is encountered, its focus traversal policy is used to perform the search operation.

				<description>
					Returns the Component that should receive the focus after aComponent. aContainer must be a focus cycle root of aComponent or a focus traversal policy provider. By default, ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy implicitly transfers focus down-cycle. That is, during normal forward focus traversal, the Component traversed after a focus cycle root will be the focus-cycle- root's default Component to focus. This behavior can be disabled using the setImplicitDownCycleTraversal method. If aContainer is focus traversal policy provider, the focus is always transferred down-cycle.

					Returns the Component that should receive the focus before aComponent. aContainer must be a focus cycle root of aComponent or a focus traversal policy provider.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the first Component in the traversal cycle. This method is used to determine the next Component to focus when traversal wraps in the forward direction.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicComponent많etLastComponent(Container마Container)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the last Component in the traversal cycle. This method is used to determine the next Component to focus when traversal wraps in the reverse direction.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					publicComponent많etDefaultComponent(Container마Container)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the default Component to focus. This Component will be the first to receive focus when traversing down into a new focus traversal cycle rooted at aContainer. The default implementation of this method returns the same Component as getFirstComponent.

				<description>
					Sets whether this ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy transfers focus down-cycle implicitly. If true, during normal forward focus traversal, the Component traversed after a focus cycle root will be the focus-cycle-root's default Component to focus. If false, the next Component in the focus traversal cycle rooted at the specified focus cycle root will be traversed instead. The default value for this property is true.

				<description>
					Returns whether this ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy transfers focus down-cycle implicitly. If true, during normal forward focus traversal, the Component traversed after a focus cycle root will be the focus-cycle-root's default Component to focus. If false, the next Component in the focus traversal cycle rooted at the specified focus cycle root will be traversed instead.

					Determines whether a Component is an acceptable choice as the new focus owner. By default, this method will accept a Component if and only if it is visible, displayable, enabled, and focusable.
