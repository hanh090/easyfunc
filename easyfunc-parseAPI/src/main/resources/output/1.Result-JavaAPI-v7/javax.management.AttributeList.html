			public class AttributeList  extends ArrayList<Object>
		</name>
		<description>
			Represents a list of values for attributes of an MBean. See the getAttributes and setAttributes methods of MBeanServer and MBeanServerConnection. For compatibility reasons, it is possible, though highly discouraged, to add objects to an AttributeList that are not instances of Attribute. However, an AttributeList can be made type-safe, which means that an attempt to add an object that is not an Attribute will produce an IllegalArgumentException. An AttributeList becomes type-safe when the method asList() is called on it.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicㅁttributeList()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an empty AttributeList.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicㅁttributeList(int말nitialCapacity)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an empty AttributeList with the initial capacity specified.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicㅁttributeList(AttributeList맓ist)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an AttributeList containing the elements of the AttributeList specified, in the order in which they are returned by the AttributeList's iterator. The AttributeList instance has an initial capacity of 110% of the size of the AttributeList specified.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicㅁttributeList(List<Attribute>맓ist)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an AttributeList containing the elements of the List specified, in the order in which they are returned by the List's iterator.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicList<Attribute>마sList()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return a view of this list as a List<Attribute>. Changes to the returned value are reflected by changes to the original AttributeList and vice versa.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid마dd(Attribute맖bject)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the Attribute specified as the last element of the list.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid마dd(int말ndex,         Attribute맖bject)
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts the attribute specified as an element at the position specified. Elements with an index greater than or equal to the current position are shifted up. If the index is out of range (index < 0 || index > size()) a RuntimeOperationsException should be raised, wrapping the java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맙et(int말ndex,         Attribute맖bject)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the element at the position specified to be the attribute specified. The previous element at that position is discarded. If the index is out of range (index < 0 || index > size() a RuntimeOperationsException should be raised, wrapping the java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean마ddAll(AttributeList맓ist)
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends all the elements in the AttributeList specified to the end of the list, in the order in which they are returned by the Iterator of the AttributeList specified.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean마ddAll(int말ndex,               AttributeList맓ist)
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts all of the elements in the AttributeList specified into this list, starting at the specified position, in the order in which they are returned by the Iterator of the AttributeList specified. If the index is out of range (index < 0 || index > size() a RuntimeOperationsException should be raised, wrapping the java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean마dd(Object만lement)
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends the specified element to the end of this list.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid마dd(int말ndex,         Object만lement)
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right (adds one to their indices).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean마ddAll(Collection<?>맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list, in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's Iterator. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress. (This implies that the behavior of this call is undefined if the specified collection is this list, and this list is nonempty.)

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean마ddAll(int말ndex,               Collection<?>맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list, starting at the specified position. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right (increases their indices). The new elements will appear in the list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicObject맙et(int말ndex,           Object만lement)
				</name>
				<description>
					Replaces the element at the specified position in this list with the specified element.
