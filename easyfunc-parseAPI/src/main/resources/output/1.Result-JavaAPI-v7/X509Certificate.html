		</name>
		<description>
			Abstract class for X.509 v1 certificates. This provides a standard way to access all the version 1 attributes of an X.509 certificate. Attributes that are specific to X.509 v2 or v3 are not available through this interface. Future API evolution will provide full access to complete X.509 v3 attributes. The basic X.509 format was defined by ISO/IEC and ANSI X9 and is described below in ASN.1:    Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {       tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,       signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,       signature            BIT STRING  }   These certificates are widely used to support authentication and other functionality in Internet security systems. Common applications include Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), Transport Layer Security (SSL), code signing for trusted software distribution, and Secure Electronic Transactions (SET). These certificates are managed and vouched for by Certificate Authorities (CAs). CAs are services which create certificates by placing data in the X.509 standard format and then digitally signing that data. CAs act as trusted third parties, making introductions between principals who have no direct knowledge of each other. CA certificates are either signed by themselves, or by some other CA such as a "root" CA. The ASN.1 definition of tbsCertificate is:    TBSCertificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {       version         [0]  EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,       serialNumber         CertificateSerialNumber,       signature            AlgorithmIdentifier,       issuer               Name,       validity             Validity,       subject              Name,       subjectPublicKeyInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo,       }   Here is sample code to instantiate an X.509 certificate:    InputStream inStream = new FileInputStream("fileName-of-cert");   X509Certificate cert = X509Certificate.getInstance(inStream);   inStream.close();   OR    byte[] certData = <certificate read from a file, say>   X509Certificate cert = X509Certificate.getInstance(certData);   In either case, the code that instantiates an X.509 certificate consults the Java security properties file to locate the actual implementation or instantiates a default implementation. The Java security properties file is located in the file named <JAVA_HOME>/lib/security/java.security. <JAVA_HOME> refers to the value of the java.home system property, and specifies the directory where the JRE is installed. In the Security properties file, a default implementation for X.509 v1 may be given such as:    cert.provider.x509v1=com.sun.security.cert.internal.x509.X509V1CertImpl   The value of this cert.provider.x509v1 property has to be changed to instatiate another implementation. If this security property is not set, a default implementation will be used. Currently, due to possible security restrictions on access to Security properties, this value is looked up and cached at class initialization time and will fallback on a default implementation if the Security property is not accessible. Note: The classes in the package javax.security.cert exist for compatibility with earlier versions of the Java Secure Sockets Extension (JSSE). New applications should instead use the standard Java SE certificate classes located in java.security.cert.

				<description>
					Instantiates an X509Certificate object, and initializes it with the data read from the input stream inStream. The implementation (X509Certificate is an abstract class) is provided by the class specified as the value of the cert.provider.x509v1 property in the security properties file. Note: Only one DER-encoded certificate is expected to be in the input stream. Also, all X509Certificate subclasses must provide a constructor of the form:    public <subClass>(InputStream inStream) ...

				</name>
				<description>
					Checks that the certificate is currently valid. It is if the current date and time are within the validity period given in the certificate. The validity period consists of two date/time values: the first and last dates (and times) on which the certificate is valid. It is defined in ASN.1 as:    validity             Validity    Validity ::= SEQUENCE {       notBefore      CertificateValidityDate,       notAfter       CertificateValidityDate }    CertificateValidityDate ::= CHOICE {       utcTime        UTCTime,       generalTime    GeneralizedTime }

				</name>
				<description>
					Checks that the specified date is within the certificate's validity period. In other words, this determines whether the certificate would be valid at the specified date/time.

					public abstractPrincipal많etIssuerDN()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the issuer (issuer distinguished name) value from the certificate. The issuer name identifies the entity that signed (and issued) the certificate. The issuer name field contains an X.500 distinguished name (DN). The ASN.1 definition for this is:    issuer    Name      Name ::= CHOICE { RDNSequence }   RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName   RelativeDistinguishedName ::=       SET OF AttributeValueAssertion     AttributeValueAssertion ::= SEQUENCE {                                 AttributeType,                                 AttributeValue }   AttributeType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER   AttributeValue ::= ANY   The Name describes a hierarchical name composed of attributes, such as country name, and corresponding values, such as US. The type of the AttributeValue component is determined by the AttributeType; in general it will be a directoryString. A directoryString is usually one of PrintableString, TeletexString or UniversalString.
