		</name>
		<description>
			Used as a base class for implementation of a local IDL interface in the Java language mapping. It is a class which implements all the operations in the org.omg.CORBA.Object interface. Local interfaces are implemented by using CORBA::LocalObject to provide implementations of Object pseudo operations and any other ORB-specific support mechanisms that are appropriate for such objects. Object implementation techniques are inherently language-mapping specific. Therefore, the LocalObject type is not defined in IDL, but is specified in each language mapping. Methods that do not apply to local objects throw an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception with the message, "This is a locally contrained object." Attempting to use a LocalObject to create a DII request results in NO_IMPLEMENT system exception. Attempting to marshal or stringify a LocalObject results in a MARSHAL system exception. Narrowing and widening references to LocalObjects must work as for regular object references. LocalObject is to be used as the base class of locally constrained objects, such as those in the PortableServer module. The specification here is based on the CORBA Components Volume I - orbos/99-07-01

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicLocalObject()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a default LocalObject instance.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean_is_equivalent(Object맚hat)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether the two object references are equivalent, so far as the ORB can easily determine. Two object references are equivalent if they are identical. Two distinct object references which in fact refer to the same object are also equivalent. However, ORBs are not required to attempt determination of whether two distinct object references refer to the same object, since such determination could be impractically expensive. Default implementation of the org.omg.CORBA.Object method.

					Throws an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception with the message "This is a locally constrained object." This method is the default implementation of the org.omg.CORBA.Object method. Called by a stub to obtain an OutputStream for marshaling arguments. The stub must supply the operation name, and indicate if a response is expected (i.e is this a oneway call).

				</name>
				<description>
					Throws an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception with the message "This is a locally constrained object." This method is the default implementation of the org.omg.CORBA.Object method. Called to invoke an operation. The stub provides an OutputStream that was previously returned by a _request() call. _invoke returns an InputStream which contains the marshaled reply. If an exception occurs, _invoke may throw an ApplicationException object which contains an InputStream from which the user exception state may be unmarshaled.

				<description>
					Throws an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception with the message "This is a locally constrained object." This method is the default implementation of the org.omg.CORBA.Object method. May optionally be called by a stub to release a reply stream back to the ORB when the unmarshaling has completed. The stub passes the InputStream returned by _invoke() or ApplicationException.getInputStream(). A null value may also be passed to _releaseReply, in which case the method is a no-op.
