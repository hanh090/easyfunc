			public class LinkedTransferQueue<E>  extends AbstractQueue<E>  implements TransferQueue<E>, Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			An unbounded TransferQueue based on linked nodes. This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out) with respect to any given producer. The head of the queue is that element that has been on the queue the longest time for some producer. The tail of the queue is that element that has been on the queue the shortest time for some producer. Beware that, unlike in most collections, the size method is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current number of elements requires a traversal of the elements, and so may report inaccurate results if this collection is modified during traversal. Additionally, the bulk operations addAll, removeAll, retainAll, containsAll, equals, and toArray are not guaranteed to be performed atomically. For example, an iterator operating concurrently with an addAll operation might view only some of the added elements. This class and its iterator implement all of the optional methods of the Collection and Iterator interfaces. Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a LinkedTransferQueue happen-before actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from the LinkedTransferQueue in another thread. This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

					public막oolean맚ryTransfer(E만)
				</name>
				<description>
					Transfers the element to a waiting consumer immediately, if possible. More precisely, transfers the specified element immediately if there exists a consumer already waiting to receive it (in take() or timed poll), otherwise returning false without enqueuing the element.

				</name>
				<description>
					Transfers the element to a consumer, waiting if necessary to do so. More precisely, transfers the specified element immediately if there exists a consumer already waiting to receive it (in take() or timed poll), else inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue and waits until the element is received by a consumer.

				</name>
				<description>
					Transfers the element to a consumer if it is possible to do so before the timeout elapses. More precisely, transfers the specified element immediately if there exists a consumer already waiting to receive it (in take() or timed poll), else inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue and waits until the element is received by a consumer, returning false if the specified wait time elapses before the element can be transferred.

					publicE맚ake()         throws InterruptedException

				<description>
					Description copied from interface:BlockingQueue Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, waiting if necessary until an element becomes available.

					publicE맗oll(long맚imeout,       TimeUnit맛nit)         throws InterruptedException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface:BlockingQueue Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, waiting up to the specified wait time if necessary for an element to become available.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicE맗oll()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface:Queue Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt맋rainTo(Collection<? super E>맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface:BlockingQueue Removes all available elements from this queue and adds them to the given collection. This operation may be more efficient than repeatedly polling this queue. A failure encountered while attempting to add elements to collection c may result in elements being in neither, either or both collections when the associated exception is thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in IllegalArgumentException. Further, the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

					public말nt맋rainTo(Collection<? super E>맊,            int맔axElements)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface:BlockingQueue Removes at most the given number of available elements from this queue and adds them to the given collection. A failure encountered while attempting to add elements to collection c may result in elements being in neither, either or both collections when the associated exception is thrown. Attempts to drain a queue to itself result in IllegalArgumentException. Further, the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicIterator<E>말terator()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue in proper sequence. The elements will be returned in order from first (head) to last (tail). The returned iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw ConcurrentModificationException, and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicE맗eek()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface:Queue Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sEmpty()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this queue contains no elements.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean맏asWaitingConsumer()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface:TransferQueue Returns true if there is at least one consumer waiting to receive an element via BlockingQueue.take() or timed poll. The return value represents a momentary state of affairs.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt맙ize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of elements in this queue. If this queue contains more than Integer.MAX_VALUE elements, returns Integer.MAX_VALUE. Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current number of elements requires an O(n) traversal.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etWaitingConsumerCount()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface:TransferQueue Returns an estimate of the number of consumers waiting to receive elements via BlockingQueue.take() or timed poll. The return value is an approximation of a momentary state of affairs, that may be inaccurate if consumers have completed or given up waiting. The value may be useful for monitoring and heuristics, but not for synchronization control. Implementations of this method are likely to be noticeably slower than those for TransferQueue.hasWaitingConsumer().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막ooleanremove(Object맖)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue, if it is present. More formally, removes an element e such that o.equals(e), if this queue contains one or more such elements. Returns true if this queue contained the specified element (or equivalently, if this queue changed as a result of the call).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean맊ontains(Object맖)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this queue contains the specified element. More formally, returns true if and only if this queue contains at least one element e such that o.equals(e).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말ntremainingCapacity()
				</name>
				<description>
					Always returns Integer.MAX_VALUE because a LinkedTransferQueue is not capacity constrained.
