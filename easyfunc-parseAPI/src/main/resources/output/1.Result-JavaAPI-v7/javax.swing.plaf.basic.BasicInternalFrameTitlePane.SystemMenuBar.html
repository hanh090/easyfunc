				<description>
					Description copied from class:JComponent Requests that this Component gets the input focus. Refer to Component.requestFocus() for a complete description of this method. Note that the use of this method is discouraged because its behavior is platform dependent. Instead we recommend the use of requestFocusInWindow(). If you would like more information on focus, see How to Use the Focus Subsystem, a section in The Java Tutorial.

				<description>
					Description copied from class:JComponent Invoked by Swing to draw components. Applications should not invoke paint directly, but should instead use the repaint method to schedule the component for redrawing. This method actually delegates the work of painting to three protected methods: paintComponent, paintBorder, and paintChildren. They're called in the order listed to ensure that children appear on top of component itself. Generally speaking, the component and its children should not paint in the insets area allocated to the border. Subclasses can just override this method, as always. A subclass that just wants to specialize the UI (look and feel) delegate's paint method should just override paintComponent.

					public막oolean말sOpaque()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:JComponent Returns true if this component is completely opaque. An opaque component paints every pixel within its rectangular bounds. A non-opaque component paints only a subset of its pixels or none at all, allowing the pixels underneath it to "show through". Therefore, a component that does not fully paint its pixels provides a degree of transparency. Subclasses that guarantee to always completely paint their contents should override this method and return true.
