		<description>
			JobState is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that identifies the current state of a print job. Class JobState defines standard job state values. A Print Service implementation only needs to report those job states which are appropriate for the particular implementation; it does not have to report every defined job state. The JobStateReasons attribute augments the JobState attribute to give more detailed information about the job in the given job state. IPP Compatibility: The category name returned by getName() is the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value. The toString() method returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalJobState UNKNOWN
				</name>
				<description>
					The job state is unknown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalJobState PENDING
				</name>
				<description>
					The job is a candidate to start processing, but is not yet processing.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalJobState PENDING_HELD
				</name>
				<description>
					The job is not a candidate for processing for any number of reasons but will return to the PENDING state as soon as the reasons are no longer present. The job's JobStateReasons attribute must indicate why the job is no longer a candidate for processing.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalJobState PROCESSING
				</name>
				<description>
					The job is processing. One or more of the following activities is occurring: The job is using, or is attempting to use, one or more purely software processes that are analyzing, creating, or interpreting a PDL, etc. The job is using, or is attempting to use, one or more hardware devices that are interpreting a PDL, making marks on a medium, and/or performing finishing, such as stapling, etc. The printer has made the job ready for printing, but the output device is not yet printing it, either because the job hasn't reached the output device or because the job is queued in the output device or some other spooler, awaiting the output device to print it. When the job is in the PROCESSING state, the entire job state includes the detailed status represented in the printer's PrinterState and PrinterStateReasons attributes. Implementations may, though they need not, include additional values in the job's JobStateReasons attribute to indicate the progress of the job, such as adding the JOB_PRINTING value to indicate when the output device is actually making marks on paper and/or the PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT value to indicate that the printer is in the process of canceling or aborting the job.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalJobState PROCESSING_STOPPED
				</name>
				<description>
					The job has stopped while processing for any number of reasons and will return to the PROCESSING state as soon as the reasons are no longer present. The job's JobStateReasons attribute may indicate why the job has stopped processing. For example, if the output device is stopped, the PRINTER_STOPPED value may be included in the job's JobStateReasons attribute. Note: When an output device is stopped, the device usually indicates its condition in human readable form locally at the device. A client can obtain more complete device status remotely by querying the printer's PrinterState and PrinterStateReasons attributes.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalJobState CANCELED
				</name>
				<description>
					The job has been canceled by some human agency, the printer has completed canceling the job, and all job status attributes have reached their final values for the job. While the printer is canceling the job, the job remains in its current state, but the job's JobStateReasons attribute should contain the PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT value and one of the CANCELED_BY_USER, CANCELED_BY_OPERATOR, or CANCELED_AT_DEVICE values. When the job moves to the CANCELED state, the PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT value, if present, must be removed, but the CANCELED_BY_xxx value, if present, must remain.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalJobState ABORTED
				</name>
				<description>
					The job has been aborted by the system (usually while the job was in the PROCESSING or PROCESSING_STOPPED state), the printer has completed aborting the job, and all job status attributes have reached their final values for the job. While the printer is aborting the job, the job remains in its current state, but the job's JobStateReasons attribute should contain the PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT and ABORTED_BY_SYSTEM values. When the job moves to the ABORTED state, the PROCESSING_TO_STOP_POINT value, if present, must be removed, but the ABORTED_BY_SYSTEM value, if present, must remain.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalJobState COMPLETED
				</name>
				<description>
					The job has completed successfully or with warnings or errors after processing, all of the job media sheets have been successfully stacked in the appropriate output bin(s), and all job status attributes have reached their final values for the job. The job's JobStateReasons attribute should contain one of these values: COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY, COMPLETED_WITH_WARNINGS, or COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS.
