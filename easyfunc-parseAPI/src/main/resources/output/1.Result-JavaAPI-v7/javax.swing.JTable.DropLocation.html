			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etRow()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the row index where a dropped item should be placed in the table. Interpretation of the value depends on the return of isInsertRow(). If that method returns true this value indicates the index where a new row should be inserted. Otherwise, it represents the value of an existing row on which the data was dropped. This index is in terms of the view. -1 indicates that the drop occurred over empty space, and no row could be calculated.
