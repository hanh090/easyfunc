		<description>
			This class provides the functionality of a cryptographic cipher for encryption and decryption. It forms the core of the Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE) framework. In order to create a Cipher object, the application calls the Cipher's getInstance method, and passes the name of the requested transformation to it. Optionally, the name of a provider may be specified. A transformation is a string that describes the operation (or set of operations) to be performed on the given input, to produce some output. A transformation always includes the name of a cryptographic algorithm (e.g., DES), and may be followed by a feedback mode and padding scheme. A transformation is of the form: "algorithm/mode/padding" or "algorithm" (in the latter case, provider-specific default values for the mode and padding scheme are used). For example, the following is a valid transformation:        Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");   Using modes such as CFB and OFB, block ciphers can encrypt data in units smaller than the cipher's actual block size. When requesting such a mode, you may optionally specify the number of bits to be processed at a time by appending this number to the mode name as shown in the "DES/CFB8/NoPadding" and "DES/OFB32/PKCS5Padding" transformations. If no such number is specified, a provider-specific default is used. (For example, the SunJCE provider uses a default of 64 bits for DES.) Thus, block ciphers can be turned into byte-oriented stream ciphers by using an 8 bit mode such as CFB8 or OFB8. Modes such as Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) provide authenticity assurances for both confidential data and Additional Associated Data (AAD) that is not encrypted. (Please see RFC 5116 for more information on AEAD and AEAD algorithms such as GCM/CCM.) Both confidential and AAD data can be used when calculating the authentication tag (similar to a Mac). This tag is appended to the ciphertext during encryption, and is verified on decryption. AEAD modes such as GCM/CCM perform all AAD authenticity calculations before starting the ciphertext authenticity calculations. To avoid implementations having to internally buffer ciphertext, all AAD data must be supplied to GCM/CCM implementations (via the updateAAD methods) before the ciphertext is processed (via the update and doFinal methods).        GCMParameterSpec s = new GCMParameterSpec(...);       cipher.init(..., s);         // If the GCMParameterSpec is needed again       cipher.getParameters().getParameterSpec(GCMParameterSpec.class));         cipher.updateAAD(...);  // AAD       cipher.update(...);     // Multi-part update       cipher.doFinal(...);    // conclusion of operation   Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the following standard Cipher transformations with the keysizes in parentheses: AES/CBC/NoPadding (128) AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding (128) AES/ECB/NoPadding (128) AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding (128) DES/CBC/NoPadding (56) DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding (56) DES/ECB/NoPadding (56) DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding (56) DESede/CBC/NoPadding (168) DESede/CBC/PKCS5Padding (168) DESede/ECB/NoPadding (168) DESede/ECB/PKCS5Padding (168) RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding (1024, 2048) RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-1AndMGF1Padding (1024, 2048) RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding (1024, 2048) These transformations are described in the Cipher section of the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation. Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any other transformations are supported.

				</name>
				<description>
					Initializes this cipher with a key. The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations: encryption, decryption, key wrapping or key unwrapping, depending on the value of opmode. If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be derived from the given key, the underlying cipher implementation is supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using provider-specific default or random values) if it is being initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an InvalidKeyException if it is being initialized for decryption or key unwrapping. The generated parameters can be retrieved using getParameters or getIV (if the parameter is an IV). If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable provider-specific default values, initialization will necessarily fail. If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme) requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get them using the SecureRandom implementation of the highest-priority installed provider as the source of randomness. (If none of the installed providers supply an implementation of SecureRandom, a system-provided source of randomness will be used.) Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing it.

Upon finishing, this method resets this cipher object to the state it was in when previously initialized via a call to init. That is, the object is reset and available to encrypt or decrypt (depending on the operation mode that was specified in the call to init) more data. Note: if any exception is thrown, this cipher object may need to be reset before it can be used again.

					Encrypts or decrypts data in a single-part operation, or finishes a multiple-part operation. The data is encrypted or decrypted, depending on how this cipher was initialized. The first inputLen bytes in the input buffer, starting at inputOffset inclusive, and any input bytes that may have been buffered during a previous update operation, are processed, with padding (if requested) being applied. If an AEAD mode such as GCM/CCM is being used, the authentication tag is appended in the case of encryption, or verified in the case of decryption. The result is stored in a new buffer. Upon finishing, this method resets this cipher object to the state it was in when previously initialized via a call to init. That is, the object is reset and available to encrypt or decrypt (depending on the operation mode that was specified in the call to init) more data.

					Encrypts or decrypts data in a single-part operation, or finishes a multiple-part operation. The data is encrypted or decrypted, depending on how this cipher was initialized. All input.remaining() bytes starting at input.position() are processed. If an AEAD mode such as GCM/CCM is being used, the authentication tag is appended in the case of encryption, or verified in the case of decryption. The result is stored in the output buffer. Upon return, the input buffer's position will be equal to its limit; its limit will not have changed. The output buffer's position will have advanced by n, where n is the value returned by this method; the output buffer's limit will not have changed. If output.remaining() bytes are insufficient to hold the result, a ShortBufferException is thrown. In this case, repeat this call with a larger output buffer.
