		<description>
			This class has been obsoleted by the 1.4 focus APIs. While client code may still use this class, developers are strongly encouraged to use java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager and java.awt.DefaultKeyboardFocusManager instead. Please see How to Use the Focus Subsystem, a section in The Java Tutorial, and the Focus Specification for more information.

				<description>
					This field is obsolete, and its use is discouraged since its specification is incompatible with the 1.4 focus APIs. The current FocusManager is no longer a property of the UI. Client code must query for the current FocusManager using KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager(). See the Focus Specification for more information.

				<description>
					Sets the current KeyboardFocusManager instance for the calling thread's context. If null is specified, then the current KeyboardFocusManager is replaced with a new instance of DefaultKeyboardFocusManager. If a SecurityManager is installed, the calling thread must be granted the AWTPermission "replaceKeyboardFocusManager" in order to replace the the current KeyboardFocusManager. If this permission is not granted, this method will throw a SecurityException, and the current KeyboardFocusManager will be unchanged.
