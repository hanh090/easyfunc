		<description>
			Class JobOriginatingUserName is a printing attribute class, a text attribute, that contains the name of the end user that submitted the print job. If possible, the printer sets this attribute to the most authenticated printable user name that it can obtain from the authentication service that authenticated the submitted Print Request. If such is not available, the printer uses the value of the RequestingUserName attribute supplied by the client in the Print Request's attribute set. If no authentication service is available, and the client did not supply a RequestingUserName attribute, the printer sets the JobOriginatingUserName attribute to an empty (zero-length) string. IPP Compatibility: The string value gives the IPP name value. The locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
