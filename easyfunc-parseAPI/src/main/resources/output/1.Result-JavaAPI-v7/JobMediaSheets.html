		<description>
			Class JobMediaSheets is an integer valued printing attribute class that specifies the total number of media sheets to be produced for this job. The JobMediaSheets attribute describes the size of the job. This attribute is not intended to be a counter; it is intended to be useful routing and scheduling information if known. The printer may try to compute the JobMediaSheets attribute's value if it is not supplied in the Print Request. Even if the client does supply a value for the JobMediaSheets attribute in the Print Request, the printer may choose to change the value if the printer is able to compute a value which is more accurate than the client supplied value. The printer may be able to determine the correct value for the JobMediaSheets attribute either right at job submission time or at any later point in time. Unlike the JobKOctets and JobImpressions attributes, the JobMediaSheets value must include the multiplicative factors contributed by the number of copies specified by the Copies attribute and a "number of copies" instruction embedded in the document data, if any. This difference allows the system administrator to control the lower and upper bounds of both (1) the size of the document(s) with JobKOctetsSupported and JobImpressionsSupported and (2) the size of the job with JobMediaSheetsSupported. IPP Compatibility: The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
