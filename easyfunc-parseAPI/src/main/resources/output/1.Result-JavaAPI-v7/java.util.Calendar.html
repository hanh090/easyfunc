		<description>
			The Calendar class is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next week. An instant in time can be represented by a millisecond value that is an offset from the Epoch, January 1, 1970 00:00:00.000 GMT (Gregorian). The class also provides additional fields and methods for implementing a concrete calendar system outside the package. Those fields and methods are defined as protected. Like other locale-sensitive classes, Calendar provides a class method, getInstance, for getting a generally useful object of this type. Calendar's getInstance method returns a Calendar object whose calendar fields have been initialized with the current date and time:        Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();   A Calendar object can produce all the calendar field values needed to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language and calendar style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional). Calendar defines the range of values returned by certain calendar fields, as well as their meaning. For example, the first month of the calendar system has value MONTH == JANUARY for all calendars. Other values are defined by the concrete subclass, such as ERA. See individual field documentation and subclass documentation for details. Getting and Setting Calendar Field Values The calendar field values can be set by calling the set methods. Any field values set in a Calendar will not be interpreted until it needs to calculate its time value (milliseconds from the Epoch) or values of the calendar fields. Calling the get, getTimeInMillis, getTime, add and roll involves such calculation. Leniency Calendar has two modes for interpreting the calendar fields, lenient and non-lenient. When a Calendar is in lenient mode, it accepts a wider range of calendar field values than it produces. When a Calendar recomputes calendar field values for return by get(), all of the calendar fields are normalized. For example, a lenient GregorianCalendar interprets MONTH == JANUARY, DAY_OF_MONTH == 32 as February 1. When a Calendar is in non-lenient mode, it throws an exception if there is any inconsistency in its calendar fields. For example, a GregorianCalendar always produces DAY_OF_MONTH values between 1 and the length of the month. A non-lenient GregorianCalendar throws an exception upon calculating its time or calendar field values if any out-of-range field value has been set. First Week Calendar defines a locale-specific seven day week using two parameters: the first day of the week and the minimal days in first week (from 1 to 7). These numbers are taken from the locale resource data when a Calendar is constructed. They may also be specified explicitly through the methods for setting their values. When setting or getting the WEEK_OF_MONTH or WEEK_OF_YEAR fields, Calendar must determine the first week of the month or year as a reference point. The first week of a month or year is defined as the earliest seven day period beginning on getFirstDayOfWeek() and containing at least getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() days of that month or year. Weeks numbered ..., -1, 0 precede the first week; weeks numbered 2, 3,... follow it. Note that the normalized numbering returned by get() may be different. For example, a specific Calendar subclass may designate the week before week 1 of a year as week n of the previous year. Calendar Fields Resolution When computing a date and time from the calendar fields, there may be insufficient information for the computation (such as only year and month with no day of month), or there may be inconsistent information (such as Tuesday, July 15, 1996 (Gregorian) -- July 15, 1996 is actually a Monday). Calendar will resolve calendar field values to determine the date and time in the following way. If there is any conflict in calendar field values, Calendar gives priorities to calendar fields that have been set more recently. The following are the default combinations of the calendar fields. The most recent combination, as determined by the most recently set single field, will be used. For the date fields:    YEAR + MONTH + DAY_OF_MONTH   YEAR + MONTH + WEEK_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK   YEAR + MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK   YEAR + DAY_OF_YEAR   YEAR + DAY_OF_WEEK + WEEK_OF_YEAR   For the time of day fields:    HOUR_OF_DAY   AM_PM + HOUR   If there are any calendar fields whose values haven't been set in the selected field combination, Calendar uses their default values. The default value of each field may vary by concrete calendar systems. For example, in GregorianCalendar, the default of a field is the same as that of the start of the Epoch: i.e., YEAR = 1970, MONTH = JANUARY, DAY_OF_MONTH = 1, etc. Note: There are certain possible ambiguities in interpretation of certain singular times, which are resolved in the following ways: 23:59 is the last minute of the day and 00:00 is the first minute of the next day. Thus, 23:59 on Dec 31, 1999 < 00:00 on Jan 1, 2000 < 00:01 on Jan 1, 2000. Although historically not precise, midnight also belongs to "am", and noon belongs to "pm", so on the same day, 12:00 am (midnight) < 12:01 am, and 12:00 pm (noon) < 12:01 pm The date or time format strings are not part of the definition of a calendar, as those must be modifiable or overridable by the user at runtime. Use DateFormat to format dates. Field Manipulation The calendar fields can be changed using three methods: set(), add(), and roll(). set(f, value) changes calendar field f to value. In addition, it sets an internal member variable to indicate that calendar field f has been changed. Although calendar field f is changed immediately, the calendar's time value in milliseconds is not recomputed until the next call to get(), getTime(), getTimeInMillis(), add(), or roll() is made. Thus, multiple calls to set() do not trigger multiple, unnecessary computations. As a result of changing a calendar field using set(), other calendar fields may also change, depending on the calendar field, the calendar field value, and the calendar system. In addition, get(f) will not necessarily return value set by the call to the set method after the calendar fields have been recomputed. The specifics are determined by the concrete calendar class. Example: Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.SEPTEMBER) sets the date to September 31, 1999. This is a temporary internal representation that resolves to October 1, 1999 if getTime()is then called. However, a call to set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 30) before the call to getTime() sets the date to September 30, 1999, since no recomputation occurs after set() itself. add(f, delta) adds delta to field f. This is equivalent to calling set(f, get(f) + delta) with two adjustments: Add rule 1. The value of field f after the call minus the value of field f before the call is delta, modulo any overflow that has occurred in field f. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range. Add rule 2. If a smaller field is expected to be invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after field f is changed or other constraints, such as time zone offset changes, then its value is adjusted to be as close as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a smaller unit of time. HOUR is a smaller field than DAY_OF_MONTH. No adjustment is made to smaller fields that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system determines what fields are expected to be invariant. In addition, unlike set(), add() forces an immediate recomputation of the calendar's milliseconds and all fields. Example: Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling add(Calendar.MONTH, 13) sets the calendar to September 30, 2000. Add rule 1 sets the MONTH field to September, since adding 13 months to August gives September of the next year. Since DAY_OF_MONTH cannot be 31 in September in a GregorianCalendar, add rule 2 sets the DAY_OF_MONTH to 30, the closest possible value. Although it is a smaller field, DAY_OF_WEEK is not adjusted by rule 2, since it is expected to change when the month changes in a GregorianCalendar. roll(f, delta) adds delta to field f without changing larger fields. This is equivalent to calling add(f, delta) with the following adjustment: Roll rule. Larger fields are unchanged after the call. A larger field represents a larger unit of time. DAY_OF_MONTH is a larger field than HOUR. Example: See GregorianCalendar.roll(int, int). Usage model. To motivate the behavior of add() and roll(), consider a user interface component with increment and decrement buttons for the month, day, and year, and an underlying GregorianCalendar. If the interface reads January 31, 1999 and the user presses the month increment button, what should it read? If the underlying implementation uses set(), it might read March 3, 1999. A better result would be February 28, 1999. Furthermore, if the user presses the month increment button again, it should read March 31, 1999, not March 28, 1999. By saving the original date and using either add() or roll(), depending on whether larger fields should be affected, the user interface can behave as most users will intuitively expect.

					public static final말nt DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH
				</name>
				<description>
					Field number for get and set indicating the ordinal number of the day of the week within the current month. Together with the DAY_OF_WEEK field, this uniquely specifies a day within a month. Unlike WEEK_OF_MONTH and WEEK_OF_YEAR, this field's value does not depend on getFirstDayOfWeek() or getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(). DAY_OF_MONTH 1 through 7 always correspond to DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH 1; 8 through 14 correspond to DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH 2, and so on. DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH 0 indicates the week before DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH 1. Negative values count back from the end of the month, so the last Sunday of a month is specified as DAY_OF_WEEK = SUNDAY, DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH = -1. Because negative values count backward they will usually be aligned differently within the month than positive values. For example, if a month has 31 days, DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH -1 will overlap DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH 5 and the end of 4.

					public final맜oid맊lear()
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets all the calendar field values and the time value (millisecond offset from the Epoch) of this Calendar undefined. This means that isSet() will return false for all the calendar fields, and the date and time calculations will treat the fields as if they had never been set. A Calendar implementation class may use its specific default field values for date/time calculations. For example, GregorianCalendar uses 1970 if the YEAR field value is undefined.

					public final맜oid맊lear(int맍ield)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the given calendar field value and the time value (millisecond offset from the Epoch) of this Calendar undefined. This means that isSet(field) will return false, and the date and time calculations will treat the field as if it had never been set. A Calendar implementation class may use the field's specific default value for date and time calculations. The HOUR_OF_DAY, HOUR and AM_PM fields are handled independently and the the resolution rule for the time of day is applied. Clearing one of the fields doesn't reset the hour of day value of this Calendar. Use set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0) to reset the hour value.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the string representation of the calendar field value in the given style and locale. If no string representation is applicable, null is returned. This method calls get(field) to get the calendar field value if the string representation is applicable to the given calendar field. For example, if this Calendar is a GregorianCalendar and its date is 2005-01-01, then the string representation of the MONTH field would be "January" in the long style in an English locale or "Jan" in the short style. However, no string representation would be available for the DAY_OF_MONTH field, and this method would return null. The default implementation supports the calendar fields for which a DateFormatSymbols has names in the given locale.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Map containing all names of the calendar field in the given style and locale and their corresponding field values. For example, if this Calendar is a GregorianCalendar, the returned map would contain "Jan" to JANUARY, "Feb" to FEBRUARY, and so on, in the short style in an English locale. The values of other calendar fields may be taken into account to determine a set of display names. For example, if this Calendar is a lunisolar calendar system and the year value given by the YEAR field has a leap month, this method would return month names containing the leap month name, and month names are mapped to their values specific for the year. The default implementation supports display names contained in a DateFormatSymbols. For example, if field is MONTH and style is ALL_STYLES, this method returns a Map containing all strings returned by DateFormatSymbols.getShortMonths() and DateFormatSymbols.getMonths().

				<description>
					Compares this Calendar to the specified Object. The result is true if and only if the argument is a Calendar object of the same calendar system that represents the same time value (millisecond offset from the Epoch) under the same Calendar parameters as this object. The Calendar parameters are the values represented by the isLenient, getFirstDayOfWeek, getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek and getTimeZone methods. If there is any difference in those parameters between the two Calendars, this method returns false. Use the compareTo method to compare only the time values.

				<description>
					Adds or subtracts the specified amount of time to the given calendar field, based on the calendar's rules. For example, to subtract 5 days from the current time of the calendar, you can achieve it by calling: add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, -5).

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract맜oidroll(int맍ield,          boolean맛p)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time field without changing larger fields. For example, to roll the current date up by one day, you can achieve it by calling: roll(Calendar.DATE, true). When rolling on the year or Calendar.YEAR field, it will roll the year value in the range between 1 and the value returned by calling getMaximum(Calendar.YEAR). When rolling on the month or Calendar.MONTH field, other fields like date might conflict and, need to be changed. For instance, rolling the month on the date 01/31/96 will result in 02/29/96. When rolling on the hour-in-day or Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY field, it will roll the hour value in the range between 0 and 23, which is zero-based.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oidroll(int맍ield,          int마mount)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified (signed) amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields. A negative amount means to roll down. NOTE: This default implementation on Calendar just repeatedly calls the version of roll() that rolls by one unit. This may not always do the right thing. For example, if the DAY_OF_MONTH field is 31, rolling through February will leave it set to 28. The GregorianCalendar version of this function takes care of this problem. Other subclasses should also provide overrides of this function that do the right thing.

					Specifies whether or not date/time interpretation is to be lenient. With lenient interpretation, a date such as "February 942, 1996" will be treated as being equivalent to the 941st day after February 1, 1996. With strict (non-lenient) interpretation, such dates will cause an exception to be thrown. The default is lenient.

				<description>
					Sets the date of this Calendar with the the given date specifiers - week year, week of year, and day of week. Unlike the set method, all of the calendar fields and time values are calculated upon return. If weekOfYear is out of the valid week-of-year range in weekYear, the weekYear and weekOfYear values are adjusted in lenient mode, or an IllegalArgumentException is thrown in non-lenient mode. The default implementation of this method throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract말nt많etLeastMaximum(int맍ield)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field of this Calendar instance. The lowest maximum value is defined as the smallest value returned by getActualMaximum(int) for any possible time value. The least maximum value depends on calendar system specific parameters of the instance. For example, a Calendar for the Gregorian calendar system returns 28 for the DAY_OF_MONTH field, because the 28th is the last day of the shortest month of this calendar, February in a common year.
