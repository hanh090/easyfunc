		</name>
		<description>
			The main class for creating a dialog window. You can use this class to create a custom dialog, or invoke the many class methods in JOptionPane to create a variety of standard dialogs. For information about creating dialogs, see The Java Tutorial section How to Make Dialogs. The JDialog component contains a JRootPane as its only child. The contentPane should be the parent of any children of the JDialog. As a convenience add and its variants, remove and setLayout have been overridden to forward to the contentPane as necessary. This means you can write:          dialog.add(child);   And the child will be added to the contentPane. The contentPane is always non-null. Attempting to set it to null generates an exception. The default contentPane has a BorderLayout manager set on it. Refer to RootPaneContainer for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager of a JDialog. Please see the JRootPane documentation for a complete description of the contentPane, glassPane, and layeredPane components. In a multi-screen environment, you can create a JDialog on a different screen device than its owner. See Frame for more information. Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more information see Swing's Threading Policy. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setDefaultCloseOperation(int operation)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the operation that will happen by default when the user initiates a "close" on this dialog. You must specify one of the following choices: DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE (defined in WindowConstants): Don't do anything; require the program to handle the operation in the windowClosing method of a registered WindowListener object. HIDE_ON_CLOSE (defined in WindowConstants): Automatically hide the dialog after invoking any registered WindowListener objects. DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE (defined in WindowConstants): Automatically hide and dispose the dialog after invoking any registered WindowListener objects. The value is set to HIDE_ON_CLOSE by default. Changes to the value of this property cause the firing of a property change event, with property name "defaultCloseOperation". Note: When the last displayable window within the Java virtual machine (VM) is disposed of, the VM may terminate. See AWT Threading Issues for more information.
				</description>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setTransferHandler(TransferHandler newHandler)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the transferHandler property, which is a mechanism to support transfer of data into this component. Use null if the component does not support data transfer operations. If the system property suppressSwingDropSupport is false (the default) and the current drop target on this component is either null or not a user-set drop target, this method will change the drop target as follows: If newHandler is null it will clear the drop target. If not null it will install a new DropTarget. Note: When used with JDialog, TransferHandler only provides data import capability, as the data export related methods are currently typed to JComponent. Please see How to Use Drag and Drop and Data Transfer, a section in The Java Tutorial, for more information.

				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified child Component. This method is overridden to conditionally forward calls to the contentPane. By default, children are added to the contentPane instead of the frame, refer to RootPaneContainer for details.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void remove(Component comp)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes the specified component from the container. If comp is not the rootPane, this will forward the call to the contentPane. This will do nothing if comp is not a child of the JDialog or contentPane.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setLayout(LayoutManager manager)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the LayoutManager. Overridden to conditionally forward the call to the contentPane. Refer to RootPaneContainer for more information.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the rootPane object for this dialog.
				</description>
				
			</method>

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setContentPane(Container contentPane)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the contentPane property. This method is called by the constructor. Swing's painting architecture requires an opaque JComponent in the containment hiearchy. This is typically provided by the content pane. If you replace the content pane it is recommended you replace it with an opaque JComponent.

				</name>
				<description>
					Repaints the specified rectangle of this component within time milliseconds. Refer to RepaintManager for details on how the repaint is handled.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static void setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated(boolean defaultLookAndFeelDecorated)
				</name>
				<description>
					Provides a hint as to whether or not newly created JDialogs should have their Window decorations (such as borders, widgets to close the window, title...) provided by the current look and feel. If defaultLookAndFeelDecorated is true, the current LookAndFeel supports providing window decorations, and the current window manager supports undecorated windows, then newly created JDialogs will have their Window decorations provided by the current LookAndFeel. Otherwise, newly created JDialogs will have their Window decorations provided by the current window manager. You can get the same effect on a single JDialog by doing the following:       JDialog dialog = new JDialog();      dialog.setUndecorated(true);      dialog.getRootPane().setWindowDecorationStyle(JRootPane.PLAIN_DIALOG);
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static boolean isDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if newly created JDialogs should have their Window decorations provided by the current look and feel. This is only a hint, as certain look and feels may not support this feature.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected String paramString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this JDialog. This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations. The returned string may be empty but may not be null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public AccessibleContext getAccessibleContext()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the AccessibleContext associated with this JDialog. For JDialogs, the AccessibleContext takes the form of an AccessibleJDialog. A new AccessibleJDialog instance is created if necessary.
