			public class TrustManagerFactory  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			This class acts as a factory for trust managers based on a source of trust material. Each trust manager manages a specific type of trust material for use by secure sockets. The trust material is based on a KeyStore and/or provider specific sources.

					public static finalString많etDefaultAlgorithm()
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains the default TrustManagerFactory algorithm name. The default TrustManager can be changed at runtime by setting the value of the "ssl.TrustManagerFactory.algorithm" security property (set in the Java security properties file or by calling Security.setProperty(String, String)) to the desired algorithm name.

			<method>
				<name>
					public finalString많etAlgorithm()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the algorithm name of this TrustManagerFactory object. This is the same name that was specified in one of the getInstance calls that created this TrustManagerFactory object.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a TrustManagerFactory object that acts as a factory for trust managers. This method traverses the list of registered security Providers, starting with the most preferred Provider. A new TrustManagerFactory object encapsulating the TrustManagerFactorySpi implementation from the first Provider that supports the specified algorithm is returned. Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via the Security.getProviders() method.

				<description>
					Returns a TrustManagerFactory object that acts as a factory for trust managers. A new KeyManagerFactory object encapsulating the KeyManagerFactorySpi implementation from the specified provider is returned. The specified provider must be registered in the security provider list. Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via the Security.getProviders() method.

				<description>
					Returns a TrustManagerFactory object that acts as a factory for trust managers. A new TrustManagerFactory object encapsulating the TrustManagerFactorySpi implementation from the specified Provider object is returned. Note that the specified Provider object does not have to be registered in the provider list.

					public final맜oid말nit(KeyStore맒s)                  throws KeyStoreException
				</name>
				<description>
					Initializes this factory with a source of certificate authorities and related trust material. The provider typically uses a KeyStore as a basis for making trust decisions. For more flexible initialization, please see init(ManagerFactoryParameters).

			<method>
				<name>
					public final맜oid말nit(ManagerFactoryParameters맙pec)                  throws InvalidAlgorithmParameterException
				</name>
				<description>
					Initializes this factory with a source of provider-specific trust material. In some cases, initialization parameters other than a keystore may be needed by a provider. Users of that particular provider are expected to pass an implementation of the appropriate ManagerFactoryParameters as defined by the provider. The provider can then call the specified methods in the ManagerFactoryParameters implementation to obtain the needed information.

			<method>
				<name>
					public finalTrustManager[]많etTrustManagers()

				<description>
					Returns one trust manager for each type of trust material.
