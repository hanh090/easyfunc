		</name>
		<description>
			Resizable-array implementation of the Deque interface. Array deques have no capacity restrictions; they grow as necessary to support usage. They are not thread-safe; in the absence of external synchronization, they do not support concurrent access by multiple threads. Null elements are prohibited. This class is likely to be faster than Stack when used as a stack, and faster than LinkedList when used as a queue. Most ArrayDeque operations run in amortized constant time. Exceptions include remove, removeFirstOccurrence, removeLastOccurrence, contains, iterator.remove(), and the bulk operations, all of which run in linear time. The iterators returned by this class's iterator method are fail-fast: If the deque is modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove method, the iterator will generally throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future. Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs. This class and its iterator implement all of the optional methods of the Collection and Iterator interfaces. This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

					public Iterator<E> descendingIterator()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: Deque Returns an iterator over the elements in this deque in reverse sequential order. The elements will be returned in order from last (tail) to first (head).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean contains(Object o)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this deque contains the specified element. More formally, returns true if and only if this deque contains at least one element e such that o.equals(e).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean remove(Object o)

				<description>
					Removes a single instance of the specified element from this deque. If the deque does not contain the element, it is unchanged. More formally, removes the first element e such that o.equals(e) (if such an element exists). Returns true if this deque contained the specified element (or equivalently, if this deque changed as a result of the call). This method is equivalent to removeFirstOccurrence(java.lang.Object).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void clear()
				</name>
				<description>

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object[] toArray()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque in proper sequence (from first to last element). The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are maintained by this deque. (In other words, this method must allocate a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array. This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque in proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If the deque fits in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this deque. If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to null. Like the toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs. Suppose x is a deque known to contain only strings. The following code can be used to dump the deque into a newly allocated array of String:        String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]); Note that toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to toArray().

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ArrayDeque<E> clone()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a copy of this deque.
