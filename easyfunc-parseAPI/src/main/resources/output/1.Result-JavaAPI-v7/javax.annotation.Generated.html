			The Generated annotation is used to mark source code that has been generated. It can also be used to differentiate user written code from generated code in a single file. When used, the value element must have the name of the code generator. The recommended convention is to use the fully qualified name of the code generator in the value field . For example: com.company.package.classname. The date element is used to indicate the date the source was generated. The date element must follow the ISO 8601 standard. For example the date element would have the following value 2001-07-04T12:08:56.235-0700 which represents 2001-07-04 12:08:56 local time in the U.S. Pacific Time time zone. The comment element is a place holder for any comments that the code generator may want to include in the generated code.
