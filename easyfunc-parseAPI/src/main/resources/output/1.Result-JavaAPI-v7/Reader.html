			public abstract class Reader  extends Object  implements Readable, Closeable
		</name>
		<description>
			Abstract class for reading character streams. The only methods that a subclass must implement are read(char[], int, int) and close(). Most subclasses, however, will override some of the methods defined here in order to provide higher efficiency, additional functionality, or both.
		</description>
		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedObject lock
				</name>
				<description>
					The object used to synchronize operations on this stream. For efficiency, a character-stream object may use an object other than itself to protect critical sections. A subclass should therefore use the object in this field rather than this or a synchronized method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedReader()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a new character-stream reader whose critical sections will synchronize on the reader itself.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedReader(Object맓ock)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a new character-stream reader whose critical sections will synchronize on the given object.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말ntread(CharBuffer맚arget)           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to read characters into the specified character buffer. The buffer is used as a repository of characters as-is: the only changes made are the results of a put operation. No flipping or rewinding of the buffer is performed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말ntread()           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads a single character. This method will block until a character is available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached. Subclasses that intend to support efficient single-character input should override this method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말ntread(char[]맊buf)           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads characters into an array. This method will block until some input is available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract말ntread(char[]맊buf,         int맖ff,         int맓en)                    throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads characters into a portion of an array. This method will block until some input is available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맓ong맙kip(long맕)            throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Skips characters. This method will block until some characters are available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막ooleanready()                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Tells whether this stream is ready to be read.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean맔arkSupported()
				</name>
				<description>
					Tells whether this stream supports the mark() operation. The default implementation always returns false. Subclasses should override this method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맔ark(intreadAheadLimit)            throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Marks the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset() will attempt to reposition the stream to this point. Not all character-input streams support the mark() operation.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oidreset()             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Resets the stream. If the stream has been marked, then attempt to reposition it at the mark. If the stream has not been marked, then attempt to reset it in some way appropriate to the particular stream, for example by repositioning it to its starting point. Not all character-input streams support the reset() operation, and some support reset() without supporting mark().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract맜oid맊lose()                      throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it. Once the stream has been closed, further read(), ready(), mark(), reset(), or skip() invocations will throw an IOException. Closing a previously closed stream has no effect.
