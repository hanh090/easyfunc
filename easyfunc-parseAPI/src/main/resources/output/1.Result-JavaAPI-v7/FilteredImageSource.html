			public class FilteredImageSource  extends Object  implements ImageProducer
		</name>
		<description>
			This class is an implementation of the ImageProducer interface which takes an existing image and a filter object and uses them to produce image data for a new filtered version of the original image. Here is an example which filters an image by swapping the red and blue compents:           Image src = getImage("doc:///demo/images/duke/T1.gif");        ImageFilter colorfilter = new RedBlueSwapFilter();        Image img = createImage(new FilteredImageSource(src.getSource(),                                                        colorfilter));

			<method>
				<name>
					publicFilteredImageSource(ImageProducer맖rig,                     ImageFilter말mgf)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an ImageProducer object from an existing ImageProducer and a filter object.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid마ddConsumer(ImageConsumer말c)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified ImageConsumer to the list of consumers interested in data for the filtered image. An instance of the original ImageFilter is created (using the filter's getFilterInstance method) to manipulate the image data for the specified ImageConsumer. The newly created filter instance is then passed to the addConsumer method of the original ImageProducer. This method is public as a side effect of this class implementing the ImageProducer interface. It should not be called from user code, and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sConsumer(ImageConsumer말c)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether an ImageConsumer is on the list of consumers currently interested in data for this image. This method is public as a side effect of this class implementing the ImageProducer interface. It should not be called from user code, and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oidremoveConsumer(ImageConsumer말c)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes an ImageConsumer from the list of consumers interested in data for this image. This method is public as a side effect of this class implementing the ImageProducer interface. It should not be called from user code, and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맙tartProduction(ImageConsumer말c)
				</name>
				<description>
					Starts production of the filtered image. If the specified ImageConsumer isn't already a consumer of the filtered image, an instance of the original ImageFilter is created (using the filter's getFilterInstance method) to manipulate the image data for the ImageConsumer. The filter instance for the ImageConsumer is then passed to the startProduction method of the original ImageProducer. This method is public as a side effect of this class implementing the ImageProducer interface. It should not be called from user code, and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oidrequestTopDownLeftRightResend(ImageConsumer말c)
				</name>
				<description>
					Requests that a given ImageConsumer have the image data delivered one more time in top-down, left-right order. The request is handed to the ImageFilter for further processing, since the ability to preserve the pixel ordering depends on the filter. This method is public as a side effect of this class implementing the ImageProducer interface. It should not be called from user code, and its behavior if called from user code is unspecified.
