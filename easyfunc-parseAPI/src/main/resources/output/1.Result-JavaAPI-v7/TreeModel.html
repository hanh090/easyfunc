		<description>
			The model used by JTree. JTree and its related classes make extensive use of TreePaths for indentifying nodes in the TreeModel. If a TreeModel returns the same object, as compared by equals, at two different indices under the same parent than the resulting TreePath objects will be considered equal as well. Some implementations may assume that if two TreePaths are equal, they identify the same node. If this condition is not met, painting problems and other oddities may result. In other words, if getChild for a given parent returns the same Object (as determined by equals) problems may result, and it is recommended you avoid doing this. Similarly JTree and its related classes place TreePaths in Maps. As such if a node is requested twice, the return values must be equal (using the equals method) and have the same hashCode. For further information on tree models, including an example of a custom implementation, see How to Use Trees in The Java Tutorial.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					Object많etRoot()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the root of the tree. Returns null only if the tree has no nodes.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Object많etChild(Object맗arent,                int말ndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the child of parent at index index in the parent's child array. parent must be a node previously obtained from this data source. This should not return null if index is a valid index for parent (that is index >= 0 && index < getChildCount(parent)).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int많etChildCount(Object맗arent)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of children of parent. Returns 0 if the node is a leaf or if it has no children. parent must be a node previously obtained from this data source.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean말sLeaf(Object맕ode)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if node is a leaf. It is possible for this method to return false even if node has no children. A directory in a filesystem, for example, may contain no files; the node representing the directory is not a leaf, but it also has no children.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void맜alueForPathChanged(TreePath맗ath,                         Object맕ewValue)
				</name>
				<description>
					Messaged when the user has altered the value for the item identified by path to newValue. If newValue signifies a truly new value the model should post a treeNodesChanged event.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int많etIndexOfChild(Object맗arent,                    Object맊hild)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the index of child in parent. If either parent or child is null, returns -1. If either parent or child don't belong to this tree model, returns -1.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void마ddTreeModelListener(TreeModelListener맓)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a listener for the TreeModelEvent posted after the tree changes.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					voidremoveTreeModelListener(TreeModelListener맓)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes a listener previously added with addTreeModelListener.
