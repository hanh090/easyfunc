		</name>
		<description>
			Basis of a text components look-and-feel. This provides the basic editor view and controller services that may be useful when creating a look-and-feel for an extension of JTextComponent. Most state is held in the associated JTextComponent as bound properties, and the UI installs default values for the various properties. This default will install something for all of the properties. Typically, a LAF implementation will do more however. At a minimum, a LAF would generally install key bindings. This class also provides some concurrency support if the Document associated with the JTextComponent is a subclass of AbstractDocument. Access to the View (or View hierarchy) is serialized between any thread mutating the model and the Swing event thread (which is expected to render, do model/view coordinate translation, etc). Any access to the root view should first acquire a read-lock on the AbstractDocument and release that lock in a finally block. An important method to define is the getPropertyPrefix() method which is used as the basis of the keys used to fetch defaults from the UIManager. The string should reflect the type of TextUI (eg. TextField, TextArea, etc) without the particular LAF part of the name (eg Metal, Motif, etc). To build a view of the model, one of the following strategies can be employed. One strategy is to simply redefine the ViewFactory interface in the UI. By default, this UI itself acts as the factory for View implementations. This is useful for simple factories. To do this reimplement the create(javax.swing.text.Element) method. A common strategy for creating more complex types of documents is to have the EditorKit implementation return a factory. Since the EditorKit ties all of the pieces necessary to maintain a type of document, the factory is typically an important part of that and should be produced by the EditorKit implementation. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedString많etKeymapName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches the name of the keymap that will be installed/used by default for this UI. This is implemented to create a name based upon the classname. The name is the the name of the class with the package prefix removed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedKeymap맊reateKeymap()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates the keymap to use for the text component, and installs any necessary bindings into it. By default, the keymap is shared between all instances of this type of TextUI. The keymap has the name defined by the getKeymapName method. If the keymap is not found, then DEFAULT_KEYMAP from JTextComponent is used. The set of bindings used to create the keymap is fetched from the UIManager using a key formed by combining the getPropertyPrefix() method and the string .keyBindings. The type is expected to be JTextComponent.KeyBinding[].
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected맜oid맗ropertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent만vt)
				</name>
				<description>
					This method gets called when a bound property is changed on the associated JTextComponent. This is a hook which UI implementations may change to reflect how the UI displays bound properties of JTextComponent subclasses. This is implemented to do nothing (i.e. the response to properties in JTextComponent itself are handled prior to calling this method). This implementation updates the background of the text component if the editable and/or enabled state changes.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected abstractString많etPropertyPrefix()

			<method>
				<name>
					protected맜oid맔odelChanged()
				</name>
				<description>
					Flags model changes. This is called whenever the model has changed. It is implemented to rebuild the view hierarchy to represent the default root element of the associated model.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected final맜oid맙etView(View맜)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the current root of the view hierarchy and calls invalidate(). If there were any child components, they will be removed (i.e. there are assumed to have come from components embedded in views).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected맜oid맗aintSafely(Graphics많)
				</name>
				<description>
					Paints the interface safely with a guarantee that the model won't change from the view of this thread. This does the following things, rendering from back to front. If the component is marked as opaque, the background is painted in the current background color of the component. The highlights (if any) are painted. The view hierarchy is painted. The caret is painted.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid말nstallUI(JComponent맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Installs the UI for a component. This does the following things. Sets the associated component to opaque if the opaque property has not already been set by the client program. This will cause the component's background color to be painted. Installs the default caret and highlighter into the associated component. These properties are only set if their current value is either null or an instance of UIResource. Attaches to the editor and model. If there is no model, a default one is created. Creates the view factory and the view hierarchy used to represent the model.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맛ninstallUI(JComponent맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Deinstalls the UI for a component. This removes the listeners, uninstalls the highlighter, removes views, and nulls out the keymap.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맛pdate(Graphics많,            JComponent맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Superclass paints background in an uncontrollable way (i.e. one might want an image tiled into the background). To prevent this from happening twice, this method is reimplemented to simply paint. NOTE: NOTE: Superclass is also not thread-safe in its rendering of the background, although that is not an issue with the default rendering.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final맜oid맗aint(Graphics많,           JComponent맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Paints the interface. This is routed to the paintSafely method under the guarantee that the model won't change from the view of this thread while it's rendering (if the associated model is derived from AbstractDocument). This enables the model to potentially be updated asynchronously.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDimension많etPreferredSize(JComponent맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the preferred size for the editor component. If the component has been given a size prior to receiving this request, it will set the size of the view hierarchy to reflect the size of the component before requesting the preferred size of the view hierarchy. This allows formatted views to format to the current component size before answering the request. Other views don't care about currently formatted size and give the same answer either way.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDimension많etMinimumSize(JComponent맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the minimum size for the editor component.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedRectangle많etVisibleEditorRect()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the allocation to give the root View. Due to an unfortunate set of historical events this method is inappropriately named. The Rectangle returned has nothing to do with visibility. The component must have a non-zero positive size for this translation to be computed.

				</name>
				<description>
					Provides a way to determine the next visually represented model location that one might place a caret. Some views may not be visible, they might not be in the same order found in the model, or they just might not allow access to some of the locations in the model.

					publicView많etRootView(JTextComponent맚c)
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches a View with the allocation of the associated text component (i.e. the root of the hierarchy) that can be traversed to determine how the model is being represented spatially. NOTE:The View hierarchy can be traversed from the root view, and other things can be done as well. Things done in this way cannot be protected like simple method calls through the TextUI. Therefore, proper operation in the presence of concurrency must be arranged by any logic that calls this method!
