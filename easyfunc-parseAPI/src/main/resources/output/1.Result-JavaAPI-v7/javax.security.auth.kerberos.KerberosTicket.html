			public class KerberosTicket  extends Object  implements Destroyable, Refreshable, Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			This class encapsulates a Kerberos ticket and associated information as viewed from the client's point of view. It captures all information that the Key Distribution Center (KDC) sends to the client in the reply message KDC-REP defined in the Kerberos Protocol Specification (RFC 4120). All Kerberos JAAS login modules that authenticate a user to a KDC should use this class. Where available, the login module might even read this information from a ticket cache in the operating system instead of directly communicating with the KDC. During the commit phase of the JAAS authentication process, the JAAS login module should instantiate this class and store the instance in the private credential set of a Subject. It might be necessary for the application to be granted a PrivateCredentialPermission if it needs to access a KerberosTicket instance from a Subject. This permission is not needed when the application depends on the default JGSS Kerberos mechanism to access the KerberosTicket. In that case, however, the application will need an appropriate ServicePermission. Note that this class is applicable to both ticket granting tickets and other regular service tickets. A ticket granting ticket is just a special case of a more generalized service ticket.

					public맜oidrefresh()               throws RefreshFailedException
				</name>
				<description>
					Extends the validity period of this ticket. The ticket will contain a new session key if the refresh operation succeeds. The refresh operation will fail if the ticket is not renewable or the latest allowable renew time has passed. Any other error returned by the KDC will also cause this method to fail. Note: This method is not synchronized with the the accessor methods of this object. Hence callers need to be aware of multiple threads that might access this and try to renew it at the same time.

				<description>
					Description copied from class:Object Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the toString method returns a string that "textually represents" this object. The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read. It is recommended that all subclasses override this method. The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character `@', and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of:    getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
