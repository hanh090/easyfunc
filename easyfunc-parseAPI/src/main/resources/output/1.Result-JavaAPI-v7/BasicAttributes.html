			public class BasicAttributes  extends Object  implements Attributes
		</name>
		<description>
			This class provides a basic implementation of the Attributes interface. BasicAttributes is either case-sensitive or case-insensitive (case-ignore). This property is determined at the time the BasicAttributes constructor is called. In a case-insensitive BasicAttributes, the case of its attribute identifiers is ignored when searching for an attribute, or adding attributes. In a case-sensitive BasicAttributes, the case is significant. When the BasicAttributes class needs to create an Attribute, it uses BasicAttribute. There is no other dependency on BasicAttribute. Note that updates to BasicAttributes (such as adding or removing an attribute) does not affect the corresponding representation in the directory. Updates to the directory can only be effected using operations in the DirContext interface. A BasicAttributes instance is not synchronized against concurrent multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a single BasicAttributes instance should lock the object.

				<description>
					Description copied from class:Object Creates and returns a copy of this object. The precise meaning of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general intent is that, for any object x, the expression:    x.clone() != x will be true, and that the expression:    x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass() will be true, but these are not absolute requirements. While it is typically the case that:    x.clone().equals(x) will be true, this is not an absolute requirement. By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling super.clone. If a class and all of its superclasses (except Object) obey this convention, it will be the case that x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass(). By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent of this object (which is being cloned). To achieve this independence, it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned by super.clone before returning it. Typically, this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure" of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the copies. If a class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually the case that no fields in the object returned by super.clone need to be modified. The method clone for class Object performs a specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does not implement the interface Cloneable, then a CloneNotSupportedException is thrown. Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface Cloneable and that the return type of the clone method of an array type T[] is T[] where T is any reference or primitive type. Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation. The class Object does not itself implement the interface Cloneable, so calling the clone method on an object whose class is Object will result in throwing an exception at run time.

				<description>
					Determines whether this BasicAttributes is equal to another Attributes Two Attributes are equal if they are both instances of Attributes, treat the case of attribute IDs the same way, and contain the same attributes. Each Attribute in this BasicAttributes is checked for equality using Object.equals(), which may have be overridden by implementations of Attribute). If a subclass overrides equals(), it should override hashCode() as well so that two Attributes instances that are equal have the same hash code.

				<description>
					Calculates the hash code of this BasicAttributes. The hash code is computed by adding the hash code of the attributes of this object. If this BasicAttributes ignores case of its attribute IDs, one is added to the hash code. If a subclass overrides hashCode(), it should override equals() as well so that two Attributes instances that are equal have the same hash code.
