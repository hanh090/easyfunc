		<description>
			Class JobMessageFromOperator is a printing attribute class, a text attribute, that provides a message from an operator, system administrator, or "intelligent" process to indicate to the end user the reasons for modification or other management action taken on a job. A Print Job's attribute set includes zero instances or one instance of a JobMessageFromOperator attribute, not more than one instance. A new JobMessageFromOperator attribute replaces an existing JobMessageFromOperator attribute, if any. In other words, JobMessageFromOperator is not intended to be a history log. If it wishes, the client can detect changes to a Print Job's JobMessageFromOperator attribute and maintain the client's own history log of the JobMessageFromOperator attribute values. IPP Compatibility: The string value gives the IPP name value. The locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
