			public class WrappedPlainView  extends BoxView  implements TabExpander
		</name>
		<description>
			View of plain text (text with only one font and color) that does line-wrapping. This view expects that its associated element has child elements that represent the lines it should be wrapping. It is implemented as a vertical box that contains logical line views. The logical line views are nested classes that render the logical line as multiple physical line if the logical line is too wide to fit within the allocation. The line views draw upon the outer class for its state to reduce their memory requirements. The line views do all of their rendering through the drawLine method which in turn does all of its rendering through the drawSelectedText and drawUnselectedText methods. This enables subclasses to easily specialize the rendering without concern for the layout aspects.

					publicWrappedPlainView(Element만lem)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a new WrappedPlainView. Lines will be wrapped on character boundaries.

				<name>
					publicWrappedPlainView(Element만lem,                  boolean망ordWrap)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a new WrappedPlainView. Lines can be wrapped on either character or word boundaries depending upon the setting of the wordWrap parameter.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected말nt많etTabSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the tab size set for the document, defaulting to 8.

				</name>
				<description>
					Renders a line of text, suppressing whitespace at the end and expanding any tabs. This is implemented to make calls to the methods drawUnselectedText and drawSelectedText so that the way selected and unselected text are rendered can be customized.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected말nt맋rawUnselectedText(Graphics많,                       int맞,                       int맟,                       int맗0,                       int맗1)                            throws BadLocationException
				</name>
				<description>
					Renders the given range in the model as normal unselected text.
				</description>

					protected말nt맋rawSelectedText(Graphics많,                     int맞,                     int맟,                     int맗0,                     int맗1)                          throws BadLocationException
				</name>
				<description>
					Renders the given range in the model as selected text. This is implemented to render the text in the color specified in the hosting component. It assumes the highlighter will render the selected background.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected finalSegment많etLineBuffer()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gives access to a buffer that can be used to fetch text from the associated document.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					protected말nt맊alculateBreakPosition(int맗0,                           int맗1)
				</name>
				<description>
					This is called by the nested wrapped line views to determine the break location. This can be reimplemented to alter the breaking behavior. It will either break at word or character boundaries depending upon the break argument given at construction.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected맜oid맓oadChildren(ViewFactory맍)
				</name>
				<description>
					Loads all of the children to initialize the view. This is called by the setParent method. Subclasses can reimplement this to initialize their child views in a different manner. The default implementation creates a child view for each child element.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맍loat맕extTabStop(float맞,                  int맚abOffset)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the next tab stop position after a given reference position. This implementation does not support things like centering so it ignores the tabOffset argument.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맗aint(Graphics많,           Shape마)
				</name>
				<description>
					Renders using the given rendering surface and area on that surface. This is implemented to stash the selection positions, selection colors, and font metrics for the nested lines to use.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맙etSize(float망idth,             float맏eight)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the size of the view. This should cause layout of the view along the given axis, if it has any layout duties.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맍loat많etPreferredSpan(int마xis)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines the preferred span for this view along an axis. This is implemented to provide the superclass behavior after first making sure that the current font metrics are cached (for the nested lines which use the metrics to determine the height of the potentially wrapped lines).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맍loat많etMinimumSpan(int마xis)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines the minimum span for this view along an axis. This is implemented to provide the superclass behavior after first making sure that the current font metrics are cached (for the nested lines which use the metrics to determine the height of the potentially wrapped lines).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맍loat많etMaximumSpan(int마xis)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines the maximum span for this view along an axis. This is implemented to provide the superclass behavior after first making sure that the current font metrics are cached (for the nested lines which use the metrics to determine the height of the potentially wrapped lines).
				</description>

				<description>
					Gives notification that something was inserted into the document in a location that this view is responsible for. This is implemented to simply update the children.
