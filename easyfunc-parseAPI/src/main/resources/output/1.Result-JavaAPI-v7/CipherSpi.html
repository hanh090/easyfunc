		<description>
			This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for the Cipher class. All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation of a particular cipher algorithm. In order to create an instance of Cipher, which encapsulates an instance of this CipherSpi class, an application calls one of the getInstance factory methods of the Cipher engine class and specifies the requested transformation. Optionally, the application may also specify the name of a provider. A transformation is a string that describes the operation (or set of operations) to be performed on the given input, to produce some output. A transformation always includes the name of a cryptographic algorithm (e.g., DES), and may be followed by a feedback mode and padding scheme. A transformation is of the form: "algorithm/mode/padding" or "algorithm" (in the latter case, provider-specific default values for the mode and padding scheme are used). For example, the following is a valid transformation:        Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");   A provider may supply a separate class for each combination of algorithm/mode/padding, or may decide to provide more generic classes representing sub-transformations corresponding to algorithm or algorithm/mode or algorithm//padding (note the double slashes), in which case the requested mode and/or padding are set automatically by the getInstance methods of Cipher, which invoke the engineSetMode and engineSetPadding methods of the provider's subclass of CipherSpi. A Cipher property in a provider master class may have one of the following formats:        // provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with       // pluggable mode and padding       Cipher.algName          // provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" in the       // specified "mode", with pluggable padding       Cipher.algName/mode          // provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the       // specified "padding", with pluggable mode       Cipher.algName//padding          // provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the       // specified "mode" and "padding"       Cipher.algName/mode/padding   For example, a provider may supply a subclass of CipherSpi that implements DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding, one that implements DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding, one that implements DES/CFB/PKCS5Padding, and yet another one that implements DES/OFB/PKCS5Padding. That provider would have the following Cipher properties in its master class:        Cipher.DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding          Cipher.DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding          Cipher.DES/CFB/PKCS5Padding          Cipher.DES/OFB/PKCS5Padding   Another provider may implement a class for each of the above modes (i.e., one class for ECB, one for CBC, one for CFB, and one for OFB), one class for PKCS5Padding, and a generic DES class that subclasses from CipherSpi. That provider would have the following Cipher properties in its master class:        Cipher.DES   The getInstance factory method of the Cipher engine class follows these rules in order to instantiate a provider's implementation of CipherSpi for a transformation of the form "algorithm": Check if the provider has registered a subclass of CipherSpi for the specified "algorithm". If the answer is YES, instantiate this class, for whose mode and padding scheme default values (as supplied by the provider) are used. If the answer is NO, throw a NoSuchAlgorithmException exception. The getInstance factory method of the Cipher engine class follows these rules in order to instantiate a provider's implementation of CipherSpi for a transformation of the form "algorithm/mode/padding": Check if the provider has registered a subclass of CipherSpi for the specified "algorithm/mode/padding" transformation. If the answer is YES, instantiate it. If the answer is NO, go to the next step. Check if the provider has registered a subclass of CipherSpi for the sub-transformation "algorithm/mode". If the answer is YES, instantiate it, and call engineSetPadding(padding) on the new instance. If the answer is NO, go to the next step. Check if the provider has registered a subclass of CipherSpi for the sub-transformation "algorithm//padding" (note the double slashes). If the answer is YES, instantiate it, and call engineSetMode(mode) on the new instance. If the answer is NO, go to the next step. Check if the provider has registered a subclass of CipherSpi for the sub-transformation "algorithm". If the answer is YES, instantiate it, and call engineSetMode(mode) and engineSetPadding(padding) on the new instance. If the answer is NO, throw a NoSuchAlgorithmException exception.

				</name>
				<description>
					Initializes this cipher with a key and a source of randomness. The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations: encryption, decryption, key wrapping or key unwrapping, depending on the value of opmode. If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be derived from the given key, the underlying cipher implementation is supposed to generate the required parameters itself (using provider-specific default or random values) if it is being initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an InvalidKeyException if it is being initialized for decryption or key unwrapping. The generated parameters can be retrieved using engineGetParameters or engineGetIV (if the parameter is an IV). If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable provider-specific default values, initialization will necessarily fail. If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme) requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get them from random. Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing it.

				<description>
					Continues a multiple-part encryption or decryption operation (depending on how this cipher was initialized), processing another data part. All input.remaining() bytes starting at input.position() are processed. The result is stored in the output buffer. Upon return, the input buffer's position will be equal to its limit; its limit will not have changed. The output buffer's position will have advanced by n, where n is the value returned by this method; the output buffer's limit will not have changed.

					Encrypts or decrypts data in a single-part operation, or finishes a multiple-part operation. The data is encrypted or decrypted, depending on how this cipher was initialized. The first inputLen bytes in the input buffer, starting at inputOffset inclusive, and any input bytes that may have been buffered during a previous update operation, are processed, with padding (if requested) being applied. If an AEAD mode such as GCM/CCM is being used, the authentication tag is appended in the case of encryption, or verified in the case of decryption. The result is stored in a new buffer. Upon finishing, this method resets this cipher object to the state it was in when previously initialized via a call to engineInit. That is, the object is reset and available to encrypt or decrypt (depending on the operation mode that was specified in the call to engineInit) more data. Note: if any exception is thrown, this cipher object may need to be reset before it can be used again.
