		<description>
			TreePath represents an array of objects that uniquely identify the path to a node in a tree. The elements of the array are ordered with the root as the first element of the array. For example, a file on the file system is uniquely identified based on the array of parent directories and the name of the file. The path /tmp/foo/bar could be represented by a TreePath as new TreePath(new Object[] {"tmp", "foo", "bar"}). TreePath is used extensively by JTree and related classes. For example, JTree represents the selection as an array of TreePaths. When used with JTree, the elements of the path are the objects returned from the TreeModel. When JTree is paired with DefaultTreeModel, the elements of the path are TreeNodes. The following example illustrates extracting the user object from the selection of a JTree:      DefaultMutableTreeNode root = ...;     DefaultTreeModel model = new DefaultTreeModel(root);     JTree tree = new JTree(model);     ...     TreePath selectedPath = tree.getSelectionPath();     DefaultMutableTreeNode selectedNode =         ((DefaultMutableTreeNode)selectedPath.getLastPathComponent()).         getUserObject();   Subclasses typically need override only getLastPathComponent, and getParentPath. As JTree internally creates TreePaths at various points, it's generally not useful to subclass TreePath and use with JTree. While TreePath is serializable, a NotSerializableException is thrown if any elements of the path are not serializable. For further information and examples of using tree paths, see How to Use Trees in The Java Tutorial. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					@ConstructorProperties(value="path")  publicTreePath(Object[]맗ath)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a TreePath from an array. The array uniquely identifies the path to a node.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicTreePath(Object맓astPathComponent)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a TreePath containing a single element. This is used to construct a TreePath identifying the root.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedTreePath(TreePath맗arent,          Object맓astPathComponent)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a TreePath with the specified parent and element.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedTreePath(Object[]맗ath,          int맓ength)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a TreePath from an array. The returned TreePath represents the elements of the array from 0 to length - 1. This constructor is used internally, and generally not useful outside of subclasses.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedTreePath()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates an empty TreePath. This is provided for subclasses that represent paths in a different manner. Subclasses that use this constructor must override getLastPathComponent, and getParentPath.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicObject[]많etPath()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an ordered array of the elements of this TreePath. The first element is the root.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicObject많etLastPathComponent()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the last element of this path.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etPathCount()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of elements in the path.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicObject많etPathComponent(int말ndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the path element at the specified index.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean만quals(Object맖)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares this TreePath to the specified object. This returns true if o is a TreePath with the exact same elements (as determined by using equals on each element of the path).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt맏ashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the hash code of this TreePath. The hash code of a TreePath is the hash code of the last element in the path.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sDescendant(TreePath마TreePath)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if aTreePath is a descendant of this TreePath. A TreePath P1 is a descendant of a TreePath P2 if P1 contains all of the elements that make up P2's path. For example, if this object has the path [a, b], and aTreePath has the path [a, b, c], then aTreePath is a descendant of this object. However, if aTreePath has the path [a], then it is not a descendant of this object. By this definition a TreePath is always considered a descendant of itself. That is, aTreePath.isDescendant(aTreePath) returns true.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicTreePath맗athByAddingChild(Object맊hild)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a new path containing all the elements of this path plus child. child is the last element of the newly created TreePath.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicTreePath많etParentPath()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the TreePath of the parent. A return value of null indicates this is the root node.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString맚oString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string that displays and identifies this object's properties.
