		</name>
		<description>
			An abstract class implementing the ImageInputStream interface. This class is designed to reduce the number of methods that must be implemented by subclasses. In particular, this class handles most or all of the details of byte order interpretation, buffering, mark/reset, discarding, closing, and disposing.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected ByteOrder byteOrder
				</name>
				<description>
					The byte order of the stream as an instance of the enumeration class java.nio.ByteOrder, where ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN indicates network byte order and ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN indicates the reverse order. By default, the value is ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN.
				</description>

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setByteOrder(ByteOrder byteOrder)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ImageInputStream Sets the desired byte order for future reads of data values from this stream. For example, the sequence of bytes '0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04' if read as a 4-byte integer would have the value '0x01020304' using network byte order and the value '0x04030201' under the reverse byte order. The enumeration class java.nio.ByteOrder is used to specify the byte order. A value of ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN specifies so-called big-endian or network byte order, in which the high-order byte comes first. Motorola and Sparc processors store data in this format, while Intel processors store data in the reverse ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN order. The byte order has no effect on the results returned from the readBits method (or the value written by ImageOutputStream.writeBits).

				</name>
				<description>
					Reads up to len bytes from the stream, and stores them into b starting at index off. If no bytes can be read because the end of the stream has been reached, -1 is returned. The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before the read occurs. Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method. The subclass implementation should update the stream position before exiting.

					public byte readByte()                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ImageInputStream Reads a byte from the stream and returns it as a byte value. Byte values between 0x00 and 0x7f represent integer values between 0 and 127.

				<name>
					public int readUnsignedByte()                       throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ImageInputStream Reads a byte from the stream, and (conceptually) converts it to an int, masks it with 0xff in order to strip off any sign-extension bits, and returns it as a byte value. Thus, byte values between 0x00 and 0x7f are simply returned as integer values between 0 and 127. Values between 0x80 and 0xff, which normally represent negative bytevalues, will be mapped into positive integers between 128 and 255. The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before the read occurs.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String readLine()                  throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ImageInputStream Reads the next line of text from the input stream. It reads successive bytes, converting each byte separately into a character, until it encounters a line terminator or end of file; the characters read are then returned as a String. Note that because this method processes bytes, it does not support input of the full Unicode character set. If end of file is encountered before even one byte can be read, then null is returned. Otherwise, each byte that is read is converted to type char by zero-extension. If the character '\n' is encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the character '\r' is encountered, it is discarded and, if the following byte converts to the character '\n', then that is discarded also; reading then ceases. If end of file is encountered before either of the characters '\n' and '\r' is encountered, reading ceases. Once reading has ceased, a String is returned that contains all the characters read and not discarded, taken in order. Note that every character in this string will have a value less than \u0100, that is, (char)256. The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before the read occurs.

			<method>
				<name>
					public String readUTF()                 throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ImageInputStream Reads in a string that has been encoded using a modified UTF-8 format. The general contract of readUTF is that it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is then returned as a String. First, two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned 16-bit integer in the manner of the readUnsignedShort method, using network byte order (regardless of the current byte order setting). This integer value is called the UTF length and specifies the number of additional bytes to be read. These bytes are then converted to characters by considering them in groups. The length of each group is computed from the value of the first byte of the group. The byte following a group, if any, is the first byte of the next group. If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern 0xxxxxxx (where x means "may be 0 or 1"), then the group consists of just that byte. The byte is zero-extended to form a character. If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern 110xxxxx, then the group consists of that byte a and a second byte b. If there is no byte b (because byte a was the last of the bytes to be read), or if byte b does not match the bit pattern 10xxxxxx, then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown. Otherwise, the group is converted to the character:    (char)(((a& 0x1F) << 6) | (b & 0x3F))   If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern 1110xxxx, then the group consists of that byte a and two more bytes b and c. If there is no byte c (because byte a was one of the last two of the bytes to be read), or either byte b or byte c does not match the bit pattern 10xxxxxx, then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown. Otherwise, the group is converted to the character:    (char)(((a & 0x0F) << 12) | ((b & 0x3F) << 6) | (c & 0x3F))   If the first byte of a group matches the pattern 1111xxxx or the pattern 10xxxxxx, then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown. If end of file is encountered at any time during this entire process, then an EOFException is thrown. After every group has been converted to a character by this process, the characters are gathered, in the same order in which their corresponding groups were read from the input stream, to form a String, which is returned. The current byte order setting is ignored. The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before the read occurs. Note: This method should not be used in the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8, because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with standard UTF-8.

				<name>
					public long readBits(int numBits)                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ImageInputStream Reads a bitstring from the stream and returns it as a long, with the first bit read becoming the most significant bit of the output. The read starts within the byte indicated by getStreamPosition, at the bit given by getBitOffset. The bit offset is advanced by numBits and reduced modulo 8. The byte order of the stream has no effect on this method. The return value of this method is constructed as though the bits were read one at a time, and shifted into the right side of the return value, as shown by the following pseudo-code:    long accum = 0L;   for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {     accum <<= 1; // Shift left one bit to make room     accum |= readBit();   }   Note that the result of readBits(32) may thus not be equal to that of readInt() if a reverse network byte order is being used (i.e., getByteOrder() == false). If the end of the stream is encountered before all the bits have been read, an EOFException is thrown.
