		<description>
			An audio input stream is an input stream with a specified audio format and length. The length is expressed in sample frames, not bytes. Several methods are provided for reading a certain number of bytes from the stream, or an unspecified number of bytes. The audio input stream keeps track of the last byte that was read. You can skip over an arbitrary number of bytes to get to a later position for reading. An audio input stream may support marks. When you set a mark, the current position is remembered so that you can return to it later. The AudioSystem class includes many methods that manipulate AudioInputStream objects. For example, the methods let you: obtain an audio input stream from an external audio file, stream, or URL write an external file from an audio input stream convert an audio input stream to a different audio format

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an audio input stream that has the requested format and length in sample frames, using audio data from the specified input stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicㅁudioInputStream(TargetDataLine맓ine)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an audio input stream that reads its data from the target data line indicated. The format of the stream is the same as that of the target data line, and the length is AudioSystem#NOT_SPECIFIED.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicㅁudioFormat많etFormat()
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains the audio format of the sound data in this audio input stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맓ong많etFrameLength()
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains the length of the stream, expressed in sample frames rather than bytes.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말ntread()           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads the next byte of data from the audio input stream. The audio input stream's frame size must be one byte, or an IOException will be thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말ntread(byte[]막)           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads some number of bytes from the audio input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. This method will always read an integral number of frames. If the length of the array is not an integral number of frames, a maximum of b.length - (b.length % frameSize) bytes will be read.

				<name>
					public말ntread(byte[]막,         int맖ff,         int맓en)           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads up to a specified maximum number of bytes of data from the audio stream, putting them into the given byte array. This method will always read an integral number of frames. If len does not specify an integral number of frames, a maximum of len - (len % frameSize) bytes will be read.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맓ong맙kip(long맕)            throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Skips over and discards a specified number of bytes from this audio input stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt마vailable()                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the maximum number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this audio input stream without blocking. This limit applies only to the next invocation of a read or skip method for this audio input stream; the limit can vary each time these methods are invoked. Depending on the underlying stream,an IOException may be thrown if this stream is closed.

					Closes this audio input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맔ark(intreadlimit)
				</name>
				<description>
