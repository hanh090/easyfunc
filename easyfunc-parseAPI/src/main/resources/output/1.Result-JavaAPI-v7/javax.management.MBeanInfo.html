			public class MBeanInfo  extends Object  implements Cloneable, Serializable, DescriptorRead
		</name>
		<description>
			Describes the management interface exposed by an MBean; that is, the set of attributes and operations which are available for management operations. Instances of this class are immutable. Subclasses may be mutable but this is not recommended. Usually the MBeanInfo for any given MBean does not change over the lifetime of that MBean. Dynamic MBeans can change their MBeanInfo and in that case it is recommended that they emit a Notification with a type of "jmx.mbean.info.changed" and a userData that is the new MBeanInfo. This is not required, but provides a conventional way for clients of the MBean to discover the change. See also the immutableInfo and infoTimeout fields in the MBeanInfo Descriptor. The contents of the MBeanInfo for a Dynamic MBean are determined by its getMBeanInfo() method. This includes Open MBeans and Model MBeans, which are kinds of Dynamic MBeans. The contents of the MBeanInfo for a Standard MBean are determined by the MBean server as follows: getClassName() returns the Java class name of the MBean object; getConstructors() returns the list of all public constructors in that object; getAttributes() returns the list of all attributes whose existence is deduced from the presence in the MBean interface of a getName, isName, or setName method that conforms to the conventions for Standard MBeans; getOperations() returns the list of all methods in the MBean interface that do not represent attributes; getNotifications() returns an empty array if the MBean does not implement the NotificationBroadcaster interface, otherwise the result of calling NotificationBroadcaster.getNotificationInfo() on it; getDescriptor() returns a descriptor containing the contents of any descriptor annotations in the MBean interface (see @DescriptorKey). The description returned by getDescription() and the descriptions of the contained attributes and operations are not specified. The remaining details of the MBeanInfo for a Standard MBean are not specified. This includes the description of any contained constructors, and notifications; the names of parameters to constructors and operations; and the descriptions of constructor parameters.

					publicObject맊lone()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a shallow clone of this instance. The clone is obtained by simply calling super.clone(), thus calling the default native shallow cloning mechanism implemented by Object.clone(). No deeper cloning of any internal field is made. Since this class is immutable, the clone method is chiefly of interest to subclasses.

					publicMBeanAttributeInfo[]많etAttributes()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the list of attributes exposed for management. Each attribute is described by an MBeanAttributeInfo object. The returned array is a shallow copy of the internal array, which means that it is a copy of the internal array of references to the MBeanAttributeInfo objects but that each referenced MBeanAttributeInfo object is not copied.

					publicMBeanOperationInfo[]많etOperations()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the list of operations of the MBean. Each operation is described by an MBeanOperationInfo object. The returned array is a shallow copy of the internal array, which means that it is a copy of the internal array of references to the MBeanOperationInfo objects but that each referenced MBeanOperationInfo object is not copied.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicMBeanConstructorInfo[]많etConstructors()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the list of the public constructors of the MBean. Each constructor is described by an MBeanConstructorInfo object. The returned array is a shallow copy of the internal array, which means that it is a copy of the internal array of references to the MBeanConstructorInfo objects but that each referenced MBeanConstructorInfo object is not copied. The returned list is not necessarily exhaustive. That is, the MBean may have a public constructor that is not in the list. In this case, the MBean server can construct another instance of this MBean's class using that constructor, even though it is not listed here.

					Returns the list of the notifications emitted by the MBean. Each notification is described by an MBeanNotificationInfo object. The returned array is a shallow copy of the internal array, which means that it is a copy of the internal array of references to the MBeanNotificationInfo objects but that each referenced MBeanNotificationInfo object is not copied.

					publicString맚oString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:Object Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the toString method returns a string that "textually represents" this object. The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read. It is recommended that all subclasses override this method. The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character `@', and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of:    getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())

				<description>
					Compare this MBeanInfo to another. Two MBeanInfo objects are equal if and only if they return equal values for getClassName(), for getDescription(), and for getDescriptor(), and the arrays returned by the two objects for getAttributes(), getOperations(), getConstructors(), and getNotifications() are pairwise equal. Here "equal" means Object.equals(Object), not identity. If two MBeanInfo objects return the same values in one of their arrays but in a different order then they are not equal.

					public말nt맏ashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:Object Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by HashMap. The general contract of hashCode is: Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application. If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the Object.equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables. As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer, but this implementation technique is not required by the JavaTM programming language.)
