		<description>
			A class for building certification paths (also known as certificate chains). This class uses a provider-based architecture. To create a CertPathBuilder, call one of the static getInstance methods, passing in the algorithm name of the CertPathBuilder desired and optionally the name of the provider desired. Once a CertPathBuilder object has been created, certification paths can be constructed by calling the build method and passing it an algorithm-specific set of parameters. If successful, the result (including the CertPath that was built) is returned in an object that implements the CertPathBuilderResult interface. Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the following standard CertPathBuilder algorithm: PKIX This algorithm is described in the CertPathBuilder section of the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation. Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any other algorithms are supported. Concurrent Access The static methods of this class are guaranteed to be thread-safe. Multiple threads may concurrently invoke the static methods defined in this class with no ill effects. However, this is not true for the non-static methods defined by this class. Unless otherwise documented by a specific provider, threads that need to access a single CertPathBuilder instance concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating a different CertPathBuilder instance need not synchronize.

					Creates a CertPathBuilder object of the given algorithm, and encapsulates the given provider implementation (SPI object) in it.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a CertPathBuilder object that implements the specified algorithm. This method traverses the list of registered security Providers, starting with the most preferred Provider. A new CertPathBuilder object encapsulating the CertPathBuilderSpi implementation from the first Provider that supports the specified algorithm is returned. Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via the Security.getProviders() method.

				<description>
					Returns a CertPathBuilder object that implements the specified algorithm. A new CertPathBuilder object encapsulating the CertPathBuilderSpi implementation from the specified provider is returned. The specified provider must be registered in the security provider list. Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via the Security.getProviders() method.

					Returns a CertPathBuilder object that implements the specified algorithm. A new CertPathBuilder object encapsulating the CertPathBuilderSpi implementation from the specified Provider object is returned. Note that the specified Provider object does not have to be registered in the provider list.

					public static finalString많etDefaultType()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the default CertPathBuilder type as specified in the Java security properties file, or the string "PKIX" if no such property exists. The Java security properties file is located in the file named <JAVA_HOME>/lib/security/java.security. <JAVA_HOME> refers to the value of the java.home system property, and specifies the directory where the JRE is installed. The default CertPathBuilder type can be used by applications that do not want to use a hard-coded type when calling one of the getInstance methods, and want to provide a default type in case a user does not specify its own. The default CertPathBuilder type can be changed by setting the value of the "certpathbuilder.type" security property (in the Java security properties file) to the desired type.
