			Enable JAXB marshalling to optimize storage of binary data. This API enables an efficient cooperative creation of optimized binary data formats between a JAXB marshalling process and a MIME-based package processor. A JAXB implementation marshals the root body of a MIME-based package, delegating the creation of referenceable MIME parts to the MIME-based package processor that implements this abstraction. XOP processing is enabled when isXOPPackage() is true. See addMtomAttachment(DataHandler, String, String) for details. WS-I Attachment Profile 1.0 is supported by addSwaRefAttachment(DataHandler) being called by the marshaller for each JAXB property related to {http://ws-i.org/profiles/basic/1.1/xsd}swaRef.

					Consider MIME content data for optimized binary storage as an attachment. This method is called by JAXB marshal process when isXOPPackage() is true, for each element whose datatype is "base64Binary", as described in Step 3 in Creating XOP Packages. The method implementor determines whether data shall be attached separately or inlined as base64Binary data. If the implementation chooses to optimize the storage of the binary data as a MIME part, it is responsible for attaching data to the MIME-based package, and then assigning an unique content-id, cid, that identifies the MIME part within the MIME message. This method returns the cid, which enables the JAXB marshaller to marshal a XOP element that refers to that cid in place of marshalling the binary data. When the method returns null, the JAXB marshaller inlines data as base64binary data. The caller of this method is required to meet the following constraint. If the element infoset item containing data has the attribute xmime:contentType or if the JAXB property/field representing datais annotated with a known MIME type, data.getContentType() should be set to that MIME type. The elementNamespace and elementLocalName parameters provide the context that contains the binary data. This information could be used by the MIME-based package processor to determine if the binary data should be inlined or optimized as an attachment.

					Consider binary data for optimized binary storage as an attachment. Since content type is not known, the attachment's MIME content type must be set to "application/octet-stream". The elementNamespace and elementLocalName parameters provide the context that contains the binary data. This information could be used by the MIME-based package processor to determine if the binary data should be inlined or optimized as an attachment.

				<description>
					Read-only property that returns true if JAXB marshaller should enable XOP creation. This value must not change during the marshalling process. When this value is true, the addMtomAttachment(...) method is invoked when the appropriate binary datatypes are encountered by the marshal process. Marshaller.marshal() must throw IllegalStateException if this value is true and the XML content to be marshalled violates Step 1 in Creating XOP Pacakges http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-xop10-20050125/#creating_xop_packages. "Ensure the Original XML Infoset contains no element information item with a [namespace name] of "http://www.w3.org/2004/08/xop/include" and a [local name] of Include" When this method returns true and during the marshal process at least one call to addMtomAttachment(...) returns a content-id, the MIME-based package processor must label the root part with the application/xop+xml media type as described in Step 5 of Creating XOP Pacakges.

					Add MIME data as an attachment and return attachment's content-id, cid. This method is called by JAXB marshal process for each element/attribute typed as {http://ws-i.org/profiles/basic/1.1/xsd}swaRef. The MIME-based package processor implementing this method is responsible for attaching the specified data to a MIME attachment, and generating a content-id, cid, that uniquely identifies the attachment within the MIME-based package. Caller inserts the returned content-id, cid, into the XML content being marshalled.
