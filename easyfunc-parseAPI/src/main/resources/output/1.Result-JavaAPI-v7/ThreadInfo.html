		<description>
			Thread information. ThreadInfo contains the information about a thread including: General thread information Thread ID. Name of the thread. Execution information Thread state. The object upon which the thread is blocked due to: waiting to enter a synchronization block/method, or waiting to be notified in a Object.wait method, or parking due to a LockSupport.park call. The ID of the thread that owns the object that the thread is blocked. Stack trace of the thread. List of object monitors locked by the thread. List of ownable synchronizers locked by the thread. Synchronization Statistics The number of times that the thread has blocked for synchronization or waited for notification. The accumulated elapsed time that the thread has blocked for synchronization or waited for notification since thread contention monitoring was enabled. Some Java virtual machine implementation may not support this. The ThreadMXBean.isThreadContentionMonitoringSupported() method can be used to determine if a Java virtual machine supports this. This thread information class is designed for use in monitoring of the system, not for synchronization control. MXBean Mapping ThreadInfo is mapped to a CompositeData with attributes as specified in the from method.

			<method>

					public맓ong많etBlockedTime()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the approximate accumulated elapsed time (in milliseconds) that the thread associated with this ThreadInfo has blocked to enter or reenter a monitor since thread contention monitoring is enabled. I.e. the total accumulated time the thread has been in the BLOCKED state since thread contention monitoring was last enabled. This method returns -1 if thread contention monitoring is disabled. The Java virtual machine may measure the time with a high resolution timer. This statistic is reset when the thread contention monitoring is reenabled.

					public맓ong많etBlockedCount()

				<description>
					Returns the total number of times that the thread associated with this ThreadInfo blocked to enter or reenter a monitor. I.e. the number of times a thread has been in the BLOCKED state.

				<name>
					public맓ong많etWaitedTime()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the approximate accumulated elapsed time (in milliseconds) that the thread associated with this ThreadInfo has waited for notification since thread contention monitoring is enabled. I.e. the total accumulated time the thread has been in the WAITING or TIMED_WAITING state since thread contention monitoring is enabled. This method returns -1 if thread contention monitoring is disabled. The Java virtual machine may measure the time with a high resolution timer. This statistic is reset when the thread contention monitoring is reenabled.

					public맓ong많etWaitedCount()

				<description>
					Returns the total number of times that the thread associated with this ThreadInfo waited for notification. I.e. the number of times that a thread has been in the WAITING or TIMED_WAITING state.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					publicLockInfo많etLockInfo()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the LockInfo of an object for which the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is blocked waiting. A thread can be blocked waiting for one of the following: an object monitor to be acquired for entering or reentering a synchronization block/method. The thread is in the BLOCKED state waiting to enter the synchronized statement or method. an object monitor to be notified by another thread. The thread is in the WAITING or TIMED_WAITING state due to a call to the Object.wait method. a synchronization object responsible for the thread parking. The thread is in the WAITING or TIMED_WAITING state due to a call to the LockSupport.park method. The synchronization object is the object returned from LockSupport.getBlocker method. Typically it is an ownable synchronizer or a Condition. This method returns null if the thread is not in any of the above conditions.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicString많etLockName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the string representation of an object for which the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is blocked waiting. This method is equivalent to calling:    getLockInfo().toString()   This method will return null if this thread is not blocked waiting for any object or if the object is not owned by any thread.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맓ong많etLockOwnerId()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the ID of the thread which owns the object for which the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is blocked waiting. This method will return -1 if this thread is not blocked waiting for any object or if the object is not owned by any thread.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString많etLockOwnerName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the name of the thread which owns the object for which the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is blocked waiting. This method will return null if this thread is not blocked waiting for any object or if the object is not owned by any thread.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicStackTraceElement[]많etStackTrace()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the stack trace of the thread associated with this ThreadInfo. If no stack trace was requested for this thread info, this method will return a zero-length array. If the returned array is of non-zero length then the first element of the array represents the top of the stack, which is the most recent method invocation in the sequence. The last element of the array represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method invocation in the sequence. Some Java virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one or more stack frames from the stack trace. In the extreme case, a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is permitted to return a zero-length array from this method.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sSuspended()
				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is suspended. This method returns true if Thread.suspend() has been called.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sInNative()
				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is executing native code via the Java Native Interface (JNI). The JNI native code does not include the virtual machine support code or the compiled native code generated by the virtual machine.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					publicString맚oString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this thread info. The format of this string depends on the implementation. The returned string will typically include the thread name, the thread ID, its state, and a stack trace if any.
