			public class DefaultCaret  extends Rectangle  implements Caret, FocusListener, MouseListener, MouseMotionListener
		</name>
		<description>
			A default implementation of Caret. The caret is rendered as a vertical line in the color specified by the CaretColor property of the associated JTextComponent. It can blink at the rate specified by the BlinkRate property. This implementation expects two sources of asynchronous notification. The timer thread fires asynchronously, and causes the caret to simply repaint the most recent bounding box. The caret also tracks change as the document is modified. Typically this will happen on the event dispatch thread as a result of some mouse or keyboard event. The caret behavior on both synchronous and asynchronous documents updates is controlled by UpdatePolicy property. The repaint of the new caret location will occur on the event thread in any case, as calls to modelToView are only safe on the event thread. The caret acts as a mouse and focus listener on the text component it has been installed in, and defines the caret semantics based upon those events. The listener methods can be reimplemented to change the semantics. By default, the first mouse button will be used to set focus and caret position. Dragging the mouse pointer with the first mouse button will sweep out a selection that is contiguous in the model. If the associated text component is editable, the caret will become visible when focus is gained, and invisible when focus is lost. The Highlighter bound to the associated text component is used to render the selection by default. Selection appearance can be customized by supplying a painter to use for the highlights. By default a painter is used that will render a solid color as specified in the associated text component in the SelectionColor property. This can easily be changed by reimplementing the getSelectionPainter method. A customized caret appearance can be achieved by reimplementing the paint method. If the paint method is changed, the damage method should also be reimplemented to cause a repaint for the area needed to render the caret. The caret extends the Rectangle class which is used to hold the bounding box for where the caret was last rendered. This enables the caret to repaint in a thread-safe manner when the caret moves without making a call to modelToView which is unstable between model updates and view repair (i.e. the order of delivery to DocumentListeners is not guaranteed). The magic caret position is set to null when the caret position changes. A timer is used to determine the new location (after the caret change). When the timer fires, if the magic caret position is still null it is reset to the current caret position. Any actions that change the caret position and want the magic caret position to remain the same, must remember the magic caret position, change the cursor, and then set the magic caret position to its original value. This has the benefit that only actions that want the magic caret position to persist (such as open/down) need to know about it. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a default caret.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setUpdatePolicy(int policy)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the caret movement policy on the document updates. Normally the caret updates its absolute position within the document on insertions occurred before or at the caret position and on removals before the caret position. 'Absolute position' means here the position relative to the start of the document. For example if a character is typed within editable text component it is inserted at the caret position and the caret moves to the next absolute position within the document due to insertion and if BACKSPACE is typed then caret decreases its absolute position due to removal of a character before it. Sometimes it may be useful to turn off the caret position updates so that the caret stays at the same absolute position within the document position regardless of any document updates. The following update policies are allowed: NEVER_UPDATE: the caret stays at the same absolute position in the document regardless of any document updates, except when document length becomes less than the current caret position due to removal. In that case caret position is adjusted to the end of the document. The caret doesn't try to keep itself visible by scrolling the associated view when using this policy. ALWAYS_UPDATE: the caret always tracks document changes. For regular changes it increases its position if an insertion occurs before or at its current position, and decreases position if a removal occurs before its current position. For undo/redo updates it is always moved to the position where update occurred. The caret also tries to keep itself visible by calling adjustVisibility method. UPDATE_WHEN_ON_EDT: acts like ALWAYS_UPDATE if the document updates are performed on the Event Dispatching Thread and like NEVER_UPDATE if updates are performed on other thread. The default property value is UPDATE_WHEN_ON_EDT.

					Renders the caret as a vertical line. If this is reimplemented the damage method should also be reimplemented as it assumes the shape of the caret is a vertical line. Sets the caret color to the value returned by getCaretColor(). If there are multiple text directions present in the associated document, a flag indicating the caret bias will be rendered. This will occur only if the associated document is a subclass of AbstractDocument and there are multiple bidi levels present in the bidi element structure (i.e. the text has multiple directions associated with it).

				<name>
					public <T extends EventListener> T[] getListeners(Class<T> listenerType)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as FooListeners upon this caret. FooListeners are registered using the addFooListener method. You can specify the listenerType argument with a class literal, such as FooListener.class. For example, you can query a DefaultCaret c for its change listeners with the following code: ChangeListener[] cls = (ChangeListener[])(c.getListeners(ChangeListener.class)); If no such listeners exist, this method returns an empty array.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSelectionVisible(boolean vis)
				</name>
				<description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isSelectionVisible()
				</name>
				<description>
					Checks whether the current selection is visible.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isActive()
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines if the caret is currently active. This method returns whether or not the Caret is currently in a blinking state. It does not provide information as to whether it is currently blinked on or off. To determine if the caret is currently painted use the isVisible method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isVisible()
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates whether or not the caret is currently visible. As the caret flashes on and off the return value of this will change between true, when the caret is painted, and false, when the caret is not painted. isActive indicates whether or not the caret is in a blinking state, such that it can be visible, and isVisible indicates whether or not the caret is actually visible. Subclasses that wish to render a different flashing caret should override paint and only paint the caret if this method returns true.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setVisible(boolean e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the caret visibility, and repaints the caret. It is important to understand the relationship between this method, isVisible and isActive. Calling this method with a value of true activates the caret blinking. Setting it to false turns it completely off. To determine whether the blinking is active, you should call isActive. In effect, isActive is an appropriate corresponding "getter" method for this one. isVisible can be used to fetch the current visibility status of the caret, meaning whether or not it is currently painted. This status will change as the caret blinks on and off. Here's a list showing the potential return values of both isActive and isVisible after calling this method: setVisible(true): isActive(): true isVisible(): true or false depending on whether or not the caret is blinked on or off setVisible(false): isActive(): false isVisible(): false
