			public abstract class TypeInfoProvider  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			This class provides access to the type information determined by ValidatorHandler. Some schema languages, such as W3C XML Schema, encourages a validator to report the "type" it assigns to each attribute/element. Those applications who wish to access this type information can invoke methods defined on this "interface" to access such type information. Implementation of this "interface" can be obtained through the ValidatorHandler.getTypeInfoProvider() method.

			<method>

				<description>
					Constructor for the derived class. The constructor does nothing.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractTypeInfo많etElementTypeInfo()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the immutable TypeInfo object for the current element. The method may only be called by the startElement event or the endElement event of the ContentHandler that the application sets to the ValidatorHandler. When W3C XML Schema validation is being performed, in the case where an element has a union type, the TypeInfo returned by a call to getElementTypeInfo() from the startElement event will be the union type. The TypeInfo returned by a call from the endElement event will be the actual member type used to validate the element.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractTypeInfo많etAttributeTypeInfo(int말ndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the immutable TypeInfo object for the specified attribute of the current element. The method may only be called by the startElement event of the ContentHandler that the application sets to the ValidatorHandler.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract막oolean말sIdAttribute(int말ndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the specified attribute is determined to be ID. Exacly how an attribute is "determined to be ID" is up to the schema language. In case of W3C XML Schema, this means that the actual type of the attribute is the built-in ID type or its derived type. A DocumentBuilder uses this information to properly implement Attr.isId(). The method may only be called by the startElement event of the ContentHandler that the application sets to the ValidatorHandler.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract막oolean말sSpecified(int말ndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns false if the attribute was added by the validator. This method provides information necessary for a DocumentBuilder to determine what the DOM tree should return from the Attr.getSpecified() method. The method may only be called by the startElement event of the ContentHandler that the application sets to the ValidatorHandler. A general guideline for validators is to return true if the attribute was originally present in the pipeline, and false if it was added by the validator.
