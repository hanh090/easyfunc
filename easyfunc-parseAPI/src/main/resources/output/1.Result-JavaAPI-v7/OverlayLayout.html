			public class OverlayLayout  extends Object  implements LayoutManager2, Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			A layout manager to arrange components over the top of each other. The requested size of the container will be the largest requested size of the children, taking alignment needs into consideration. The alignment is based upon what is needed to properly fit the children in the allocation area. The children will be placed such that their alignment points are all on top of each other. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
