		<description>
			The String class represents character strings. All string literals in Java programs, such as "abc", are implemented as instances of this class. Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they are created. String buffers support mutable strings. Because String objects are immutable they can be shared. For example:        String str = "abc";   is equivalent to:        char data[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};       String str = new String(data);   Here are some more examples of how strings can be used:        System.out.println("abc");       String cde = "cde";       System.out.println("abc" + cde);       String c = "abc".substring(2,3);       String d = cde.substring(1, 2);   The class String includes methods for examining individual characters of the sequence, for comparing strings, for searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a copy of a string with all characters translated to uppercase or to lowercase. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version specified by the Character class. The Java language provides special support for the string concatenation operator ( + ), and for conversion of other objects to strings. String concatenation is implemented through the StringBuilder(or StringBuffer) class and its append method. String conversions are implemented through the method toString, defined by Object and inherited by all classes in Java. For additional information on string concatenation and conversion, see Gosling, Joy, and Steele, The Java Language Specification. Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in this class will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown. A String represents a string in the UTF-16 format in which supplementary characters are represented by surrogate pairs (see the section Unicode Character Representations in the Character class for more information). Index values refer to char code units, so a supplementary character uses two positions in a String. The String class provides methods for dealing with Unicode code points (i.e., characters), in addition to those for dealing with Unicode code units (i.e., char values).

				<name>
					public static final Comparator<String> CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER
				</name>
				<description>
					A Comparator that orders String objects as by compareToIgnoreCase. This comparator is serializable. Note that this Comparator does not take locale into account, and will result in an unsatisfactory ordering for certain locales. The java.text package provides Collators to allow locale-sensitive ordering.

				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated. This method does not properly convert bytes into characters. As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the String constructors that take a Charset, charset name, or that use the platform's default charset. Allocates a new String constructed from a subarray of an array of 8-bit integer values. The offset argument is the index of the first byte of the subarray, and the count argument specifies the length of the subarray. Each byte in the subarray is converted to a char as specified in the method above.

					Returns the character (Unicode code point) at the specified index. The index refers to char values (Unicode code units) and ranges from 0 to length() - 1. If the char value specified at the given index is in the high-surrogate range, the following index is less than the length of this String, and the char value at the following index is in the low-surrogate range, then the supplementary code point corresponding to this surrogate pair is returned. Otherwise, the char value at the given index is returned.

				</name>
				<description>
					Copies characters from this string into the destination character array. The first character to be copied is at index srcBegin; the last character to be copied is at index srcEnd-1 (thus the total number of characters to be copied is srcEnd-srcBegin). The characters are copied into the subarray of dst starting at index dstBegin and ending at index:        dstbegin + (srcEnd-srcBegin) - 1

				<description>
					Deprecated. This method does not properly convert characters into bytes. As of JDK 1.1, the preferred way to do this is via the getBytes() method, which uses the platform's default charset. Copies characters from this string into the destination byte array. Each byte receives the 8 low-order bits of the corresponding character. The eight high-order bits of each character are not copied and do not participate in the transfer in any way. The first character to be copied is at index srcBegin; the last character to be copied is at index srcEnd-1. The total number of characters to be copied is srcEnd-srcBegin. The characters, converted to bytes, are copied into the subarray of dst starting at index dstBegin and ending at index:        dstbegin + (srcEnd-srcBegin) - 1

				<description>
					Compares this String to another String, ignoring case considerations. Two strings are considered equal ignoring case if they are of the same length and corresponding characters in the two strings are equal ignoring case. Two characters c1 and c2 are considered the same ignoring case if at least one of the following is true: The two characters are the same (as compared by the == operator) Applying the method Character.toUpperCase(char) to each character produces the same result Applying the method Character.toLowerCase(char) to each character produces the same result
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int compareTo(String anotherString)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares two strings lexicographically. The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings. The character sequence represented by this String object is compared lexicographically to the character sequence represented by the argument string. The result is a negative integer if this String object lexicographically precedes the argument string. The result is a positive integer if this String object lexicographically follows the argument string. The result is zero if the strings are equal; compareTo returns 0 exactly when the equals(Object) method would return true. This is the definition of lexicographic ordering. If two strings are different, then either they have different characters at some index that is a valid index for both strings, or their lengths are different, or both. If they have different characters at one or more index positions, let k be the smallest such index; then the string whose character at position k has the smaller value, as determined by using the < operator, lexicographically precedes the other string. In this case, compareTo returns the difference of the two character values at position k in the two string -- that is, the value:    this.charAt(k)-anotherString.charAt(k)   If there is no index position at which they differ, then the shorter string lexicographically precedes the longer string. In this case, compareTo returns the difference of the lengths of the strings -- that is, the value:    this.length()-anotherString.length()
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public int compareToIgnoreCase(String str)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case differences. This method returns an integer whose sign is that of calling compareTo with normalized versions of the strings where case differences have been eliminated by calling Character.toLowerCase(Character.toUpperCase(character)) on each character. Note that this method does not take locale into account, and will result in an unsatisfactory ordering for certain locales. The java.text package provides collators to allow locale-sensitive ordering.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified character. If a character with value ch occurs in the character sequence represented by this String object, then the index (in Unicode code units) of the first such occurrence is returned. For values of ch in the range from 0 to 0xFFFF (inclusive), this is the smallest value k such that:    this.charAt(k) == ch   is true. For other values of ch, it is the smallest value k such that:    this.codePointAt(k) == ch   is true. In either case, if no such character occurs in this string, then -1 is returned.

					Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified character, starting the search at the specified index. If a character with value ch occurs in the character sequence represented by this String object at an index no smaller than fromIndex, then the index of the first such occurrence is returned. For values of ch in the range from 0 to 0xFFFF (inclusive), this is the smallest value k such that:    (this.charAt(k) == ch) && (k >= fromIndex)   is true. For other values of ch, it is the smallest value k such that:    (this.codePointAt(k) == ch) && (k >= fromIndex)   is true. In either case, if no such character occurs in this string at or after position fromIndex, then -1 is returned. There is no restriction on the value of fromIndex. If it is negative, it has the same effect as if it were zero: this entire string may be searched. If it is greater than the length of this string, it has the same effect as if it were equal to the length of this string: -1 is returned. All indices are specified in char values (Unicode code units).

					public String substring(int beginIndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a new string that is a substring of this string. The substring begins with the character at the specified index and extends to the end of this string. Examples:    "unhappy".substring(2) returns "happy"   "Harbison".substring(3) returns "bison"   "emptiness".substring(9) returns "" (an empty string)

					public String substring(int beginIndex,                 int endIndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a new string that is a substring of this string. The substring begins at the specified beginIndex and extends to the character at index endIndex - 1. Thus the length of the substring is endIndex-beginIndex. Examples:    "hamburger".substring(4, 8) returns "urge"   "smiles".substring(1, 5) returns "mile"

					public CharSequence subSequence(int beginIndex,                         int endIndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a new character sequence that is a subsequence of this sequence. An invocation of this method of the form    str.subSequence(begin, end) behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation    str.substring(begin, end) This method is defined so that the String class can implement the CharSequence interface.

			<method>
				<name>
					public String concat(String str)
				</name>
				<description>
					Concatenates the specified string to the end of this string. If the length of the argument string is 0, then this String object is returned. Otherwise, a new String object is created, representing a character sequence that is the concatenation of the character sequence represented by this String object and the character sequence represented by the argument string. Examples:    "cares".concat("s") returns "caress"   "to".concat("get").concat("her") returns "together"

					public String replace(char oldChar,               char newChar)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a new string resulting from replacing all occurrences of oldChar in this string with newChar. If the character oldChar does not occur in the character sequence represented by this String object, then a reference to this String object is returned. Otherwise, a new String object is created that represents a character sequence identical to the character sequence represented by this String object, except that every occurrence of oldChar is replaced by an occurrence of newChar. Examples:    "mesquite in your cellar".replace('e', 'o')           returns "mosquito in your collar"   "the war of baronets".replace('r', 'y')           returns "the way of bayonets"   "sparring with a purple porpoise".replace('p', 't')           returns "starring with a turtle tortoise"   "JonL".replace('q', 'x') returns "JonL" (no change)

					public String replaceFirst(String regex,                    String replacement)
				</name>
				<description>
					Replaces the first substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement. An invocation of this method of the form str.replaceFirst(regex, repl) yields exactly the same result as the expression Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(str).replaceFirst(repl) Note that backslashes (\) and dollar signs ($) in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string; see Matcher.replaceFirst(java.lang.String). Use Matcher.quoteReplacement(java.lang.String) to suppress the special meaning of these characters, if desired.

					public String replace(CharSequence target,               CharSequence replacement)
				</name>
				<description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public String[] split(String regex,               int limit)
				</name>
				<description>
					Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression. The array returned by this method contains each substring of this string that is terminated by another substring that matches the given expression or is terminated by the end of the string. The substrings in the array are in the order in which they occur in this string. If the expression does not match any part of the input then the resulting array has just one element, namely this string. The limit parameter controls the number of times the pattern is applied and therefore affects the length of the resulting array. If the limit n is greater than zero then the pattern will be applied at most n - 1 times, the array's length will be no greater than n, and the array's last entry will contain all input beyond the last matched delimiter. If n is non-positive then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible and the array can have any length. If n is zero then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible, the array can have any length, and trailing empty strings will be discarded. The string "boo:and:foo", for example, yields the following results with these parameters: Regex Limit Result : 2 { "boo", "and:foo" } : 5 { "boo", "and", "foo" } : -2 { "boo", "and", "foo" } o 5 { "b", "", ":and:f", "", "" } o -2 { "b", "", ":and:f", "", "" } o 0 { "b", "", ":and:f" } An invocation of this method of the form str.split(regex, n) yields the same result as the expression Pattern.compile(regex).split(str, n)
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String[] split(String regex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression. This method works as if by invoking the two-argument split method with the given expression and a limit argument of zero. Trailing empty strings are therefore not included in the resulting array. The string "boo:and:foo", for example, yields the following results with these expressions: Regex Result : { "boo", "and", "foo" } o { "b", "", ":and:f" }

				<name>
					public String toLowerCase(Locale locale)
				</name>
				<description>
					Converts all of the characters in this String to lower case using the rules of the given Locale. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version specified by the Character class. Since case mappings are not always 1:1 char mappings, the resulting String may be a different length than the original String. Examples of lowercase mappings are in the following table: Language Code of Locale Upper Case Lower Case Description tr (Turkish) \u0130 \u0069 capital letter I with dot above -> small letter i tr (Turkish) \u0049 \u0131 capital letter I -> small letter dotless i (all) French Fries french fries lowercased all chars in String (all) lowercased all chars in String

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String toLowerCase()
				</name>
				<description>
					Converts all of the characters in this String to lower case using the rules of the default locale. This is equivalent to calling toLowerCase(Locale.getDefault()). Note: This method is locale sensitive, and may produce unexpected results if used for strings that are intended to be interpreted locale independently. Examples are programming language identifiers, protocol keys, and HTML tags. For instance, "TITLE".toLowerCase() in a Turkish locale returns "t\u0131tle", where '\u0131' is the LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I character. To obtain correct results for locale insensitive strings, use toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH).

					Converts all of the characters in this String to upper case using the rules of the given Locale. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version specified by the Character class. Since case mappings are not always 1:1 char mappings, the resulting String may be a different length than the original String. Examples of locale-sensitive and 1:M case mappings are in the following table. Language Code of Locale Lower Case Upper Case Description tr (Turkish) \u0069 \u0130 small letter i -> capital letter I with dot above tr (Turkish) \u0131 \u0049 small letter dotless i -> capital letter I (all) \u00df \u0053 \u0053 small letter sharp s -> two letters: SS (all) Fahrvergnügen FAHRVERGNÜGEN

			<method>
				<name>
					public String trim()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a copy of the string, with leading and trailing whitespace omitted. If this String object represents an empty character sequence, or the first and last characters of character sequence represented by this String object both have codes greater than '\u0020' (the space character), then a reference to this String object is returned. Otherwise, if there is no character with a code greater than '\u0020' in the string, then a new String object representing an empty string is created and returned. Otherwise, let k be the index of the first character in the string whose code is greater than '\u0020', and let m be the index of the last character in the string whose code is greater than '\u0020'. A new String object is created, representing the substring of this string that begins with the character at index k and ends with the character at index m-that is, the result of this.substring(k, m+1). This method may be used to trim whitespace (as defined above) from the beginning and end of a string.

Otherwise, this String object is added to the pool and a reference to this String object is returned. It follows that for any two strings s and t, s.intern() == t.intern() is true if and only if s.equals(t) is true. All literal strings and string-valued constant expressions are interned. String literals are defined in section 3.10.5 of the The Java™ Language Specification.
