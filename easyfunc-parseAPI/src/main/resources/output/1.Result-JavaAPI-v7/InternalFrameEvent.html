			public class InternalFrameEvent  extends AWTEvent
		</name>
		<description>
			An AWTEvent that adds support for JInternalFrame objects as the event source. This class has the same event types as WindowEvent, although different IDs are used. Help on handling internal frame events is in How to Write an Internal Frame Listener, a section in The Java Tutorial. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
