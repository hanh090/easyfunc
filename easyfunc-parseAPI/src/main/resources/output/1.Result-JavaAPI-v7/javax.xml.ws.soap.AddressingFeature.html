			AddressingFeature represents the use of WS-Addressing with either the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP binding. Using this feature with any other binding is undefined. This feature can be used during the creation of SEI proxy, and Dispatch instances on the client side and Endpoint instances on the server side. This feature cannot be used for Service instance creation on the client side. The following describes the effects of this feature with respect to be enabled or disabled: ENABLED: In this Mode, WS-Addressing will be enabled. It means the endpoint supports WS-Addressing but does not require its use. A sender could send messages with WS-Addressing headers or without WS-Addressing headers. But a receiver MUST consume both types of messages. DISABLED: In this Mode, WS-Addressing will be disabled. At runtime, WS-Addressing headers MUST NOT be used by a sender or receiver. If the feature is enabled, the required property determines whether the endpoint requires WS-Addressing. If it is set true, WS-Addressing headers MUST be present on incoming and outgoing messages. By default the required property is false. If the web service developer has not explicitly enabled this feature, WSDL's wsam:Addressing policy assertion is used to find the use of WS-Addressing. By using the feature explicitly, an application overrides WSDL's indication of the use of WS-Addressing. In some cases, this is really required. For example, if an application has implemented WS-Addressing itself, it can use this feature to disable addressing. That means a JAX-WS implementation doesn't consume or produce WS-Addressing headers. If addressing is enabled, a corresponding wsam:Addressing policy assertion must be generated in the WSDL as per 3.1 WS-Policy Assertions Example 1: Possible Policy Assertion in the generated WSDL for @Addressing      <wsam:Addressing wsp:Optional="true">       <wsp:Policy/>     </wsam:Addressing>   Example 2: Possible Policy Assertion in the generated WSDL for @Addressing(required=true)      <wsam:Addressing>       <wsp:Policy/>     </wsam:Addressing>   Example 3: Possible Policy Assertion in the generated WSDL for @Addressing(required=true, responses=Responses.ANONYMOUS)      <wsam:Addressing>        <wsp:Policy>          <wsam:AnonymousResponses/>        </wsp:Policy>     </wsam:Addressing>   See Web Services Addressing - Core, Web Services Addressing 1.0 - SOAP Binding, and Web Services Addressing 1.0 - Metadata for more information on WS-Addressing.
