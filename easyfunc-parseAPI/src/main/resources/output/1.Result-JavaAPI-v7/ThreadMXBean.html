		<description>
			The management interface for the thread system of the Java virtual machine. A Java virtual machine has a single instance of the implementation class of this interface. This instance implementing this interface is an MXBean that can be obtained by calling the ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean() method or from the platform MBeanServer method. The ObjectName for uniquely identifying the MXBean for the thread system within an MBeanServer is: java.lang:type=Threading It can be obtained by calling the PlatformManagedObject.getObjectName() method. Thread ID Thread ID is a positive long value returned by calling the Thread.getId() method for a thread. The thread ID is unique during its lifetime. When a thread is terminated, this thread ID may be reused. Some methods in this interface take a thread ID or an array of thread IDs as the input parameter and return per-thread information. Thread CPU time A Java virtual machine implementation may support measuring the CPU time for the current thread, for any thread, or for no threads. The isThreadCpuTimeSupported() method can be used to determine if a Java virtual machine supports measuring of the CPU time for any thread. The isCurrentThreadCpuTimeSupported() method can be used to determine if a Java virtual machine supports measuring of the CPU time for the current thread. A Java virtual machine implementation that supports CPU time measurement for any thread will also support that for the current thread. The CPU time provided by this interface has nanosecond precision but not necessarily nanosecond accuracy. A Java virtual machine may disable CPU time measurement by default. The isThreadCpuTimeEnabled() and setThreadCpuTimeEnabled(boolean) methods can be used to test if CPU time measurement is enabled and to enable/disable this support respectively. Enabling thread CPU measurement could be expensive in some Java virtual machine implementations. Thread Contention Monitoring Some Java virtual machines may support thread contention monitoring. When thread contention monitoring is enabled, the accumulated elapsed time that the thread has blocked for synchronization or waited for notification will be collected and returned in the ThreadInfo object. The isThreadContentionMonitoringSupported() method can be used to determine if a Java virtual machine supports thread contention monitoring. The thread contention monitoring is disabled by default. The setThreadContentionMonitoringEnabled(boolean) method can be used to enable thread contention monitoring. Synchronization Information and Deadlock Detection Some Java virtual machines may support monitoring of object monitor usage and ownable synchronizer usage. The getThreadInfo(long[], boolean, boolean) and dumpAllThreads(boolean, boolean) methods can be used to obtain the thread stack trace and synchronization information including which lock a thread is blocked to acquire or waiting on and which locks the thread currently owns. The ThreadMXBean interface provides the findMonitorDeadlockedThreads() and findDeadlockedThreads() methods to find deadlocks in the running application.

				<description>
					Returns the total CPU time for the current thread in nanoseconds. The returned value is of nanoseconds precision but not necessarily nanoseconds accuracy. If the implementation distinguishes between user mode time and system mode time, the returned CPU time is the amount of time that the current thread has executed in user mode or system mode.

				<description>
					Returns the total CPU time for a thread of the specified ID in nanoseconds. The returned value is of nanoseconds precision but not necessarily nanoseconds accuracy. If the implementation distinguishes between user mode time and system mode time, the returned CPU time is the amount of time that the thread has executed in user mode or system mode. If the thread of the specified ID is not alive or does not exist, this method returns -1. If CPU time measurement is disabled, this method returns -1. A thread is alive if it has been started and has not yet died. If CPU time measurement is enabled after the thread has started, the Java virtual machine implementation may choose any time up to and including the time that the capability is enabled as the point where CPU time measurement starts.

				<name>
					long[]맍indMonitorDeadlockedThreads()
				</name>
				<description>
					Finds cycles of threads that are in deadlock waiting to acquire object monitors. That is, threads that are blocked waiting to enter a synchronization block or waiting to reenter a synchronization block after an Object.wait call, where each thread owns one monitor while trying to obtain another monitor already held by another thread in a cycle. More formally, a thread is monitor deadlocked if it is part of a cycle in the relation "is waiting for an object monitor owned by". In the simplest case, thread A is blocked waiting for a monitor owned by thread B, and thread B is blocked waiting for a monitor owned by thread A. This method is designed for troubleshooting use, but not for synchronization control. It might be an expensive operation. This method finds deadlocks involving only object monitors. To find deadlocks involving both object monitors and ownable synchronizers, the findDeadlockedThreads method should be used.

				<description>
					Finds cycles of threads that are in deadlock waiting to acquire object monitors or ownable synchronizers. Threads are deadlocked in a cycle waiting for a lock of these two types if each thread owns one lock while trying to acquire another lock already held by another thread in the cycle. This method is designed for troubleshooting use, but not for synchronization control. It might be an expensive operation.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the thread info for each thread whose ID is in the input array ids, with stack trace and synchronization information. This method obtains a snapshot of the thread information for each thread including: the entire stack trace, the object monitors currently locked by the thread if lockedMonitors is true, and the ownable synchronizers currently locked by the thread if lockedSynchronizers is true. This method returns an array of the ThreadInfo objects, each is the thread information about the thread with the same index as in the ids array. If a thread of the given ID is not alive or does not exist, null will be set in the corresponding element in the returned array. A thread is alive if it has been started and has not yet died. If a thread does not lock any object monitor or lockedMonitors is false, the returned ThreadInfo object will have an empty MonitorInfo array. Similarly, if a thread does not lock any synchronizer or lockedSynchronizers is false, the returned ThreadInfo object will have an empty LockInfo array. When both lockedMonitors and lockedSynchronizers parameters are false, it is equivalent to calling:        getThreadInfo(ids, Integer.MAX_VALUE)   This method is designed for troubleshooting use, but not for synchronization control. It might be an expensive operation. MBeanServer access: The mapped type of ThreadInfo is CompositeData with attributes as specified in the ThreadInfo.from method.
