		<description>
			Interface PrintJobAttributeSet specifies the interface for a set of print job attributes, i.e. printing attributes that implement interface PrintJobAttribute. In the Print Service API, a service uses a PrintJobAttributeSet to report the status of a print job. A PrintJobAttributeSet is just an AttributeSet whose constructors and mutating operations guarantee an additional invariant, namely that all attribute values in the PrintJobAttributeSet must be instances of interface PrintJobAttribute. The add(Attribute), and addAll(AttributeSet) operations are respecified below to guarantee this additional invariant.

					boolean마dd(Attribute마ttribute)

				<description>
					Adds the specified attribute value to this attribute set if it is not already present, first removing any existing value in the same attribute category as the specified attribute value (optional operation).

			<method>
				<name>
					boolean마ddAll(AttributeSet마ttributes)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds all of the elements in the specified set to this attribute. The outcome is the same as if the add(Attribute) operation had been applied to this attribute set successively with each element from the specified set. If none of the categories in the specified set are the same as any categories in this attribute set, the addAll() operation effectively modifies this attribute set so that its value is the union of the two sets. The behavior of the addAll() operation is unspecified if the specified set is modified while the operation is in progress. If the addAll() operation throws an exception, the effect on this attribute set's state is implementation dependent; elements from the specified set before the point of the exception may or may not have been added to this attribute set.
