			public abstract class HttpExchange  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			This class encapsulates a HTTP request received and a response to be generated in one exchange. It provides methods for examining the request from the client, and for building and sending the response. A HttpExchange must be closed to free or reuse underlying resources. The effect of failing to close an exchange is undefined.

					public static finalString REQUEST_CIPHER_SUITE
				</name>
				<description>
					Standard property: cipher suite value when the request is received over HTTPS Type: String
				</description>

				</name>
				<description>

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>

				</name>
				<description>
					Standard property: A SSL certificate, if any, associated with the request Type: java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] The order of this array is defined as being in ascending order of trust. The first certificate in the chain is the one set by the client, the next is the one used to authenticate the first, and so on.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractMap<String,List<String>>많etRequestHeaders()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an immutable Map containing the HTTP headers that were included with this request. The keys in this Map will be the header names, while the values will be a List of Strings containing each value that was included (either for a header that was listed several times, or one that accepts a comma-delimited list of values on a single line). In either of these cases, the values for the header name will be presented in the order that they were included in the request. The keys in Map are case-insensitive.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractString많etRequestHeader(String맕ame)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value of the specified request header. If the request did not include a header of the specified name, this method returns null. If there are multiple headers with the same name, this method returns the first header in the request. The header name is case-insensitive. This is a convienence method to get a header (instead of using the getRequestHeaders()).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractMap<String,List<String>>많etResponseHeaders()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a mutable Map into which the HTTP response headers can be stored and which will be transmitted as part of this response. The keys in the Map will be the header names, while the values must be a List of Strings containing each value that should be included multiple times (in the order that they should be included). The keys in Map are case-insensitive.

				<name>
					public abstract맜oid마ddResponseHeader(String맕ame,                       String맜alue)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a response header with the given name and value. This method allows a response header to have multiple values. This is a convenience method to add a response header(instead of using the getResponseHeaders()).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractString많etRequestURI()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the part of the request's URI from the protocol name up to the query string in the first line of the HTTP request. Container doesn't decode this string.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractString많etContextPath()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the context path of all the endpoints in an application. This path is the portion of the request URI that indicates the context of the request. The context path always comes first in a request URI. The path starts with a "/" character but does not end with a "/" character. If this method returns "", the request is for default context. The container does not decode this string. Context path is used in computing the endpoint address. See HttpContext.getPath()
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractString많etRequestMethod()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the HTTP request method
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractHttpContext많etHttpContext()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a HttpContext for this exchange. Container matches the request with the associated Endpoint's HttpContext
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract맜oid맊lose()                      throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					This must be called to end an exchange. Container takes care of closing request and response streams. This must be called so that the container can free or reuse underlying resources.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractInputStream많etRequestBody()                                      throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a stream from which the request body can be read. Multiple calls to this method will return the same stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>

					public abstractOutputStream많etResponseBody()                                        throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a stream to which the response body must be written. setStatus(int)) must be called prior to calling this method. Multiple calls to this method (for the same exchange) will return the same stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract맜oid맙etStatus(int맙tatus)

			</method>
			<method>

					public abstractString많etScheme()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the name of the scheme used to make this request, for example: http, or https.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractString많etPathInfo()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the extra path information that follows the web service path but precedes the query string in the request URI and will start with a "/" character. This can be used for MessageContext.PATH_INFO
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractString많etQueryString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the query string that is contained in the request URI after the path. This can be used for MessageContext.QUERY_STRING

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractObject많etAttribute(String맕ame)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an attribute that is associated with this HttpExchange. JAX-WS handlers and endpoints may then access the attribute via MessageContext. Servlet containers must expose MessageContext.SERVLET_CONTEXT, MessageContext.SERVLET_REQUEST, and MessageContext.SERVLET_RESPONSE as attributes. If the request has been received by the container using HTTPS, the following information must be exposed as attributes. These attributes are REQUEST_CIPHER_SUITE, and REQUEST_KEY_SIZE. If there is a SSL certificate associated with the request, it must be exposed using REQUEST_X509CERTIFICATE
				</description>
