		</name>
		<description>
			An object used in Request operations to describe the exceptions that can be thrown by a method. It maintains a modifiable list of TypeCodes of the exceptions. The following code fragment demonstrates creating an ExceptionList object:       ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null);      org.omg.CORBA.ExceptionList excList = orb.create_exception_list();   The variable excList represents an ExceptionList object with no TypeCode objects in it. To add items to the list, you first create a TypeCode object for the exception you want to include, using the ORB method create_exception_tc. Then you use the ExceptionList method add to add it to the list. The class ExceptionList has a method for getting the number of TypeCode objects in the list, and after items have been added, it is possible to call methods for accessing or deleting an item at a designated index.
