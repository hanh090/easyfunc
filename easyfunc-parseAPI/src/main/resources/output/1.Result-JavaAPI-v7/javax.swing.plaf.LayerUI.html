			public class LayerUI<V extends Component>  extends ComponentUI  implements Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			The base class for all JLayer's UI delegates. paint(java.awt.Graphics, javax.swing.JComponent) method performs the painting of the JLayer and eventDispatched(AWTEvent, JLayer) method is notified about any AWTEvents which have been generated by a JLayer or any of its subcomponents. The LayerUI differs from the UI delegates of the other components, because it is LookAndFeel independent and is not updated by default when the system LookAndFeel is changed. The subclasses of LayerUI can either be stateless and shareable by multiple JLayers or not shareable.

				</name>
				<description>
					Processes AWTEvents for JLayer and all its descendants to this LayerUI instance. To enable the AWTEvents of a particular type, you call JLayer.setLayerEventMask(long) in installUI(javax.swing.JComponent) and set the layer event mask to 0 in uninstallUI(javax.swing.JComponent) after that. By default this method calls the appropriate process&lt;event&nbsp;type&gt;Event method for the given class of event. Note: Events are processed only for displayable JLayers.
