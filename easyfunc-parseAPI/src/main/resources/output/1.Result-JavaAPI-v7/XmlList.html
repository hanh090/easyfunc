			Used to map a property to a list simple type. Usage The @XmlList annotation can be used with the following program elements: JavaBean property field When a collection property is annotated just with @XmlElement, each item in the collection will be wrapped by an element. For example,    @XmlRootElement   class Foo {       @XmlElement       List<String> data;   }   would produce XML like this:    <foo>     <data>abc     <data>def   </foo>   @XmlList annotation, on the other hand, allows multiple values to be represented as whitespace-separated tokens in a single element. For example,    @XmlRootElement   class Foo {       @XmlElement       @XmlList       List<String> data;   }   the above code will produce XML like this:    <foo>     <data>abc def   </foo>   This annotation can be used with the following annotations: XmlElement, XmlAttribute, XmlValue, XmlIDREF. The use of @XmlList with XmlValue while allowed, is redundant since XmlList maps a collection type to a simple schema type that derives by list just as XmlValue would. The use of @XmlList with XmlAttribute while allowed, is redundant since XmlList maps a collection type to a simple schema type that derives by list just as XmlAttribute would.
