		<description>
			The AudioSystem class acts as the entry point to the sampled-audio system resources. This class lets you query and access the mixers that are installed on the system. AudioSystem includes a number of methods for converting audio data between different formats, and for translating between audio files and streams. It also provides a method for obtaining a Line directly from the AudioSystem without dealing explicitly with mixers. Properties can be used to specify the default mixer for specific line types. Both system properties and a properties file are considered. In the Oracle reference implementation, the properties file is "lib/sound.properties" in the JRE directory. If a property exists both as a system property and in the properties file, the system property takes precedence. If none is specified, a suitable default is chosen among the available devices. The syntax of the properties file is specified in Properties.load. The following table lists the available property keys and which methods consider them: Property Key Interface Affected Method(s) javax.sound.sampled.Clip Clip getLine(javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info), getClip() javax.sound.sampled.Port Port getLine(javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info) javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine SourceDataLine getLine(javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info), getSourceDataLine(javax.sound.sampled.AudioFormat) javax.sound.sampled.TargetDataLine TargetDataLine getLine(javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info), getTargetDataLine(javax.sound.sampled.AudioFormat) The property value consists of the provider class name and the mixer name, separated by the hash mark ("#"). The provider class name is the fully-qualified name of a concrete mixer provider class. The mixer name is matched against the String returned by the getName method of Mixer.Info. Either the class name, or the mixer name may be omitted. If only the class name is specified, the trailing hash mark is optional. If the provider class is specified, and it can be successully retrieved from the installed providers, the list of Mixer.Info objects is retrieved from the provider. Otherwise, or when these mixers do not provide a subsequent match, the list is retrieved from getMixerInfo() to contain all available Mixer.Info objects. If a mixer name is specified, the resulting list of Mixer.Info objects is searched: the first one with a matching name, and whose Mixer provides the respective line interface, will be returned. If no matching Mixer.Info object is found, or the mixer name is not specified, the first mixer from the resulting list, which provides the respective line interface, will be returned. For example, the property javax.sound.sampled.Clip with a value "com.sun.media.sound.MixerProvider#SunClip" will have the following consequences when getLine is called requesting a Clip instance: if the class com.sun.media.sound.MixerProvider exists in the list of installed mixer providers, the first Clip from the first mixer with name "SunClip" will be returned. If it cannot be found, the first Clip from the first mixer of the specified provider will be returned, regardless of name. If there is none, the first Clip from the first Mixer with name "SunClip" in the list of all mixers (as returned by getMixerInfo) will be returned, or, if not found, the first Clip of the first Mixerthat can be found in the list of all mixers is returned. If that fails, too, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int NOT_SPECIFIED
				</name>
				<description>
					An integer that stands for an unknown numeric value. This value is appropriate only for signed quantities that do not normally take negative values. Examples include file sizes, frame sizes, buffer sizes, and sample rates. A number of Java Sound constructors accept a value of NOT_SPECIFIED for such parameters. Other methods may also accept or return this value, as documented.

				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains a line that matches the description in the specified Line.Info object. If a DataLine is requested, and info is an instance of DataLine.Info specifying at least one fully qualified audio format, the last one will be used as the default format of the returned DataLine. If system properties javax.sound.sampled.Clip, javax.sound.sampled.Port, javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine and javax.sound.sampled.TargetDataLine are defined or they are defined in the file "sound.properties", they are used to retrieve default lines. For details, refer to the class description. If the respective property is not set, or the mixer requested in the property is not installed or does not provide the requested line, all installed mixers are queried for the requested line type. A Line will be returned from the first mixer providing the requested line type.

				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains the audio file format of the provided input stream. The stream must point to valid audio file data. The implementation of this method may require multiple parsers to examine the stream to determine whether they support it. These parsers must be able to mark the stream, read enough data to determine whether they support the stream, and, if not, reset the stream's read pointer to its original position. If the input stream does not support these operations, this method may fail with an IOException.
