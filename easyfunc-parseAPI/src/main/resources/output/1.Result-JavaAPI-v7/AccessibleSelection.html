		<description>
			This AccessibleSelection interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine what the current selected children are, as well as modify the selection set. Any object that has children that can be selected should support the AccessibleSelection interface. Applications can determine if an object supports the AccessibleSelection interface by first obtaining its AccessibleContext (see Accessible) and then calling the AccessibleContext.getAccessibleSelection() method. If the return value is not null, the object supports this interface.
