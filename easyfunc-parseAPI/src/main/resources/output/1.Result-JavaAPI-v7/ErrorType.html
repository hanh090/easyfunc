			public interface ErrorType  extends DeclaredType

		<description>
			Represents a class or interface type that cannot be properly modeled. This may be the result of a processing error, such as a missing class file or erroneous source code. Most queries for information derived from such a type (such as its members or its supertype) will not, in general, return meaningful results.
