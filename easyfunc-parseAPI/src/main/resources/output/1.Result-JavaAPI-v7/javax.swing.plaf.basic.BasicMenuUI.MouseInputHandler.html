			protected class BasicMenuUI.MouseInputHandler  extends Object  implements MouseInputListener
		</name>
		<description>
			Instantiated and used by a menu item to handle the current menu selection from mouse events. A MouseInputHandler processes and forwards all mouse events to a shared instance of the MenuSelectionManager. This class is protected so that it can be subclassed by other look and feels to implement their own mouse handling behavior. All overridden methods should call the parent methods so that the menu selection is correct.
