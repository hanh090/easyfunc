		<description>
			Defines operations on the base class that represents the Sending Context of a request. The sending context provides access to information about the runtime environment of the originator of a GIOP message. For example, when a value type is marshalled on a GIOP Request message, the receiver of the value type may need to ask the sender about the CodeBase for the implementation of the value type.
