		<description>
			An input stream used for custom mapping user-defined types (UDTs). An SQLInputImpl object is an input stream that contains a stream of values that are the attributes of a UDT. This class is used by the driver behind the scenes when the method getObject is called on an SQL structured or distinct type that has a custom mapping; a programmer never invokes SQLInputImpl methods directly. They are provided here as a convenience for those who write RowSet implementations. The SQLInputImpl class provides a set of reader methods analogous to the ResultSet getter methods. These methods make it possible to read the values in an SQLInputImpl object. The method wasNull is used to determine whether the the last value read was SQL NULL. When the method getObject is called with an object of a class implementing the interface SQLData, the JDBC driver calls the method SQLData.getSQLType to determine the SQL type of the UDT being custom mapped. The driver creates an instance of SQLInputImpl, populating it with the attributes of the UDT. The driver then passes the input stream to the method SQLData.readSQL, which in turn calls the SQLInputImpl reader methods to read the attributes from the input stream.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Object readObject()                    throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the value at the head of this SQLInputImpl object as an Object in the Java programming language. The actual type of the object returned is determined by the default mapping of SQL types to types in the Java programming language unless there is a custom mapping, in which case the type of the object returned is determined by this stream's type map. The JDBC technology-enabled driver registers a type map with the stream before passing the stream to the application. When the datum at the head of the stream is an SQL NULL, this method returns null. If the datum is an SQL structured or distinct type with a custom mapping, this method determines the SQL type of the datum at the head of the stream, constructs an object of the appropriate class, and calls the method SQLData.readSQL on that object. The readSQL method then calls the appropriate SQLInputImpl.readXXX methods to retrieve the attribute values from the stream.
