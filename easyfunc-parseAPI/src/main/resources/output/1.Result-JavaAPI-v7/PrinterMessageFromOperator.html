		<description>
			Class PrinterMessageFromOperator is a printing attribute class, a text attribute, that provides a message from an operator, system administrator, or "intelligent" process to indicate to the end user information about or status of the printer, such as why it is unavailable or when it is expected to be available. A Print Service's attribute set includes zero instances or one instance of a PrinterMessageFromOperator attribute, not more than one instance. A new PrinterMessageFromOperator attribute replaces an existing PrinterMessageFromOperator attribute, if any. In other words, PrinterMessageFromOperator is not intended to be a history log. If it wishes, the client can detect changes to a Print Service's PrinterMessageFromOperator attribute and maintain the client's own history log of the PrinterMessageFromOperator attribute values. IPP Compatibility: The string value gives the IPP name value. The locale gives the IPP natural language. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
