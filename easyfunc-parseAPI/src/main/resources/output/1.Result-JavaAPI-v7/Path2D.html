		<description>
			The Path2D class provides a simple, yet flexible shape which represents an arbitrary geometric path. It can fully represent any path which can be iterated by the PathIterator interface including all of its segment types and winding rules and it implements all of the basic hit testing methods of the Shape interface. Use Path2D.Float when dealing with data that can be represented and used with floating point precision. Use Path2D.Double for data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision. Path2D provides exactly those facilities required for basic construction and management of a geometric path and implementation of the above interfaces with little added interpretation. If it is useful to manipulate the interiors of closed geometric shapes beyond simple hit testing then the Area class provides additional capabilities specifically targeted at closed figures. While both classes nominally implement the Shape interface, they differ in purpose and together they provide two useful views of a geometric shape where Path2D deals primarily with a trajectory formed by path segments and Area deals more with interpretation and manipulation of enclosed regions of 2D geometric space. The PathIterator interface has more detailed descriptions of the types of segments that make up a path and the winding rules that control how to determine which regions are inside or outside the path.

					Returns a new Shape representing a transformed version of this Path2D. Note that the exact type and coordinate precision of the return value is not specified for this method. The method will return a Shape that contains no less precision for the transformed geometry than this Path2D currently maintains, but it may contain no more precision either. If the tradeoff of precision vs. storage size in the result is important then the convenience constructors in the Path2D.Float and Path2D.Double subclasses should be used to make the choice explicit.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final Rectangle getBounds()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an integer Rectangle that completely encloses the Shape. Note that there is no guarantee that the returned Rectangle is the smallest bounding box that encloses the Shape, only that the Shape lies entirely within the indicated Rectangle. The returned Rectangle might also fail to completely enclose the Shape if the Shape overflows the limited range of the integer data type. The getBounds2D method generally returns a tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in representation. Note that the definition of insideness can lead to situations where points on the defining outline of the shape may not be considered contained in the returned bounds object, but only in cases where those points are also not considered contained in the original shape. If a point is inside the shape according to the contains(point) method, then it must be inside the returned Rectangle bounds object according to the contains(point) method of the bounds. Specifically: shape.contains(x,y) requires bounds.contains(x,y) If a point is not inside the shape, then it might still be contained in the bounds object: bounds.contains(x,y) does not imply shape.contains(x,y)

				<description>
					Tests if the specified rectangular area is entirely inside the closed boundary of the specified PathIterator. This method provides a basic facility for implementors of the Shape interface to implement support for the Shape.contains(double, double, double, double) method. This method object may conservatively return false in cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a segment of the path, but that segment does not represent a boundary between the interior and exterior of the path. Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the path if they are part of a path with a WIND_NON_ZERO winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each other out without any exterior area falling between them. To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of the interior of the path would require extensive calculations involving all of the segments of the path and the winding rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.

				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape entirely contains the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside the rectangular area must lie within the Shape for the entire rectanglar area to be considered contained within the Shape. The Shape.contains() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return false when: the intersect method returns true and the calculations to determine whether or not the Shape entirely contains the rectangular area are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return false even though the Shape contains the rectangular area. The Area class performs more accurate geometric computations than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required. This method object may conservatively return false in cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a segment of the path, but that segment does not represent a boundary between the interior and exterior of the path. Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the path if they are part of a path with a WIND_NON_ZERO winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each other out without any exterior area falling between them.

					Tests if the interior of the Shape intersects the interior of a specified rectangular area.

					public final PathIterator getPathIterator(AffineTransform at,                             double flatness)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an iterator object that iterates along the Shape boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the Shape outline geometry. Only SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, and SEG_CLOSE point types are returned by the iterator. If an optional AffineTransform is specified, the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed accordingly. The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled by the flatness parameter, which specifies the maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments. Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be silently imposed, causing very small flattening parameters to be treated as larger values. This limit, if there is one, is defined by the particular implementation that is used. Each call to this method returns a fresh PathIterator object that traverses the Shape object geometry independently from any other PathIterator objects in use at the same time. It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects implementing the Shape interface isolate iterations that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original object's geometry during such iterations. The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe, which means that this Path2D class does not guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this Path2D object do not affect any iterations of that geometry that are already in process.
