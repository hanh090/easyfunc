			public class ConcurrentLinkedDeque<E>  extends AbstractCollection<E>  implements Deque<E>, Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			An unbounded concurrent deque based on linked nodes. Concurrent insertion, removal, and access operations execute safely across multiple threads. A ConcurrentLinkedDeque is an appropriate choice when many threads will share access to a common collection. Like most other concurrent collection implementations, this class does not permit the use of null elements. Iterators are weakly consistent, returning elements reflecting the state of the deque at some point at or since the creation of the iterator. They do not throw ConcurrentModificationException, and may proceed concurrently with other operations. Beware that, unlike in most collections, the size method is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these deques, determining the current number of elements requires a traversal of the elements, and so may report inaccurate results if this collection is modified during traversal. Additionally, the bulk operations addAll, removeAll, retainAll, containsAll, equals, and toArray are not guaranteed to be performed atomically. For example, an iterator operating concurrently with an addAll operation might view only some of the added elements. This class and its iterator implement all of the optional methods of the Deque and Iterator interfaces. Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a ConcurrentLinkedDeque happen-before actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from the ConcurrentLinkedDeque in another thread. This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int size()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of elements in this deque. If this deque contains more than Integer.MAX_VALUE elements, it returns Integer.MAX_VALUE. Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these deques, determining the current number of elements requires traversing them all to count them. Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during execution of this method, in which case the returned result will be inaccurate. Thus, this method is typically not very useful in concurrent applications.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean remove(Object o)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes the first element e such that o.equals(e), if such an element exists in this deque. If the deque does not contain the element, it is unchanged.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this deque, in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator. Attempts to addAll of a deque to itself result in IllegalArgumentException.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void clear()
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes all of the elements from this deque.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object[] toArray()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque, in proper sequence (from first to last element). The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are maintained by this deque. (In other words, this method must allocate a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array. This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque, in proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If the deque fits in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this deque. If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to null. Like the toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs. Suppose x is a deque known to contain only strings. The following code can be used to dump the deque into a newly allocated array of String:        String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]); Note that toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to toArray().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Iterator<E> iterator()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an iterator over the elements in this deque in proper sequence. The elements will be returned in order from first (head) to last (tail). The returned iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw ConcurrentModificationException, and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Iterator<E> descendingIterator()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an iterator over the elements in this deque in reverse sequential order. The elements will be returned in order from last (tail) to first (head). The returned iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw ConcurrentModificationException, and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.
