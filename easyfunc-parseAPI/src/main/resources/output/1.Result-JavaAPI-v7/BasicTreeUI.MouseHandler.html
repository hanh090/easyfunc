				<description>
					Description copied from class:MouseAdapter Invoked when a mouse button is pressed on a component and then dragged. MOUSE_DRAGGED events will continue to be delivered to the component where the drag originated until the mouse button is released (regardless of whether the mouse position is within the bounds of the component). Due to platform-dependent Drag&Drop implementations, MOUSE_DRAGGED events may not be delivered during a native Drag&Drop operation.
