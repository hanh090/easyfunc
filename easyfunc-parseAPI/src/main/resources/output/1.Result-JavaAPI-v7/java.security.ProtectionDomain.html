			public class ProtectionDomain  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			This ProtectionDomain class encapsulates the characteristics of a domain, which encloses a set of classes whose instances are granted a set of permissions when being executed on behalf of a given set of Principals. A static set of permissions can be bound to a ProtectionDomain when it is constructed; such permissions are granted to the domain regardless of the Policy in force. However, to support dynamic security policies, a ProtectionDomain can also be constructed such that it is dynamically mapped to a set of permissions by the current Policy whenever a permission is checked.

				<description>
					Creates a new ProtectionDomain with the given CodeSource and Permissions. If the permissions object is not null, then setReadOnly()) will be called on the passed in Permissions object. The only permissions granted to this domain are the ones specified; the current Policy will not be consulted.

				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a new ProtectionDomain qualified by the given CodeSource, Permissions, ClassLoader and array of Principals. If the permissions object is not null, then setReadOnly() will be called on the passed in Permissions object. The permissions granted to this domain are dynamic; they include both the static permissions passed to this constructor, and any permissions granted to this domain by the current Policy at the time a permission is checked. This constructor is typically used by ClassLoaders and DomainCombiners which delegate to Policy to actively associate the permissions granted to this domain. This constructor affords the Policy provider the opportunity to augment the supplied PermissionCollection to reflect policy changes.

				<description>
					Check and see if this ProtectionDomain implies the permissions expressed in the Permission object. The set of permissions evaluated is a function of whether the ProtectionDomain was constructed with a static set of permissions or it was bound to a dynamically mapped set of permissions. If the ProtectionDomain was constructed to a statically bound PermissionCollection then the permission will only be checked against the PermissionCollection supplied at construction. However, if the ProtectionDomain was constructed with the constructor variant which supports dynamically binding permissions, then the permission will be checked against the combination of the PermissionCollection supplied at construction and the current Policy binding.
