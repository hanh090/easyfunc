		<description>
			This class represents a composite name -- a sequence of component names spanning multiple namespaces. Each component is a string name from the namespace of a naming system. If the component comes from a hierarchical namespace, that component can be further parsed into its atomic parts by using the CompoundName class. The components of a composite name are numbered. The indexes of a composite name with N components range from 0 up to, but not including, N. This range may be written as [0,N). The most significant component is at index 0. An empty composite name has no components. JNDI Composite Name Syntax JNDI defines a standard string representation for composite names. This representation is the concatenation of the components of a composite name from left to right using the component separator (a forward slash character (/)) to separate each component. The JNDI syntax defines the following meta characters: escape (backward slash \), quote characters (single (') and double quotes (")), and component separator (forward slash character (/)). Any occurrence of a leading quote, an escape preceding any meta character, an escape at the end of a component, or a component separator character in an unquoted component must be preceded by an escape character when that component is being composed into a composite name string. Alternatively, to avoid adding escape characters as described, the entire component can be quoted using matching single quotes or matching double quotes. A single quote occurring within a double-quoted component is not considered a meta character (and need not be escaped), and vice versa. When two composite names are compared, the case of the characters is significant. A leading component separator (the composite name string begins with a separator) denotes a leading empty component (a component consisting of an empty string). A trailing component separator (the composite name string ends with a separator) denotes a trailing empty component. Adjacent component separators denote an empty component. Composite Name Examples This table shows examples of some composite names. Each row shows the string form of a composite name and its corresponding structural form (CompositeName). String Name CompositeName "" {} (the empty name == new CompositeName("") == new CompositeName()) "x" {"x"} "x/y" {"x", "y"} "x/" {"x", ""} "/x" {"", "x"} "/" {""} "//" {"", ""} "/x/" {"", "x", ""} "x//y" {"x", "", "y"} Composition Examples Here are some composition examples. The right column shows composing string composite names while the left column shows composing the corresponding CompositeNames. Notice that composing the string forms of two composite names simply involves concatenating their string forms together. String Names CompositeNames "x/y" + "/" = x/y/ {"x", "y"} + {""} = {"x", "y", ""} "" + "x" = "x" {} + {"x"} = {"x"} "/" + "x" = "/x" {""} + {"x"} = {"", "x"} "x" + "" + "" = "x" {"x"} + {} + {} = {"x"} Multithreaded Access A CompositeName instance is not synchronized against concurrent multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a CompositeName should lock the object.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedCompositeName(Enumeration<String>맊omps)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new composite name instance using the components specified by 'comps'. This protected method is intended to be to be used by subclasses of CompositeName when they override methods such as clone(), getPrefix(), getSuffix().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicCompositeName(String맕)                throws InvalidNameException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new composite name instance by parsing the string n using the composite name syntax (left-to-right, slash separated). The composite name syntax is described in detail in the class description.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicCompositeName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new empty composite name. Such a name returns true when isEmpty() is invoked on it.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString맚oString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Generates the string representation of this composite name. The string representation consists of enumerating in order each component of the composite name and separating each component by a forward slash character. Quoting and escape characters are applied where necessary according to the JNDI syntax, which is described in the class description. An empty component is represented by an empty string. The string representation thus generated can be passed to the CompositeName constructor to create a new equivalent composite name.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean만quals(Object맖bj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether two composite names are equal. If obj is null or not a composite name, false is returned. Two composite names are equal if each component in one is equal to the corresponding component in the other. This implies both have the same number of components, and each component's equals() test against the corresponding component in the other name returns true.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt맏ashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Computes the hash code of this composite name. The hash code is the sum of the hash codes of individual components of this composite name.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt맊ompareTo(Object맖bj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares this CompositeName with the specified Object for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Name is less than, equal to, or greater than the given Object. If obj is null or not an instance of CompositeName, ClassCastException is thrown. See equals() for what it means for two composite names to be equal. If two composite names are equal, 0 is returned. Ordering of composite names follows the lexicographical rules for string comparison, with the extension that this applies to all the components in the composite name. The effect is as if all the components were lined up in their specified ordered and the lexicographical rules applied over the two line-ups. If this composite name is "lexicographically" lesser than obj, a negative number is returned. If this composite name is "lexicographically" greater than obj, a positive number is returned.
