		<description>
			A GlyphView is a styled chunk of text that represents a view mapped over an element in the text model. This view is generally responsible for displaying text glyphs using character level attributes in some way. An implementation of the GlyphPainter class is used to do the actual rendering and model/view translations. This separates rendering from layout and management of the association with the model. The view supports breaking for the purpose of formatting. The fragments produced by breaking share the view that has primary responsibility for the element (i.e. they are nested classes and carry only a small amount of state of their own) so they can share its resources. Since this view represents text that may have tabs embedded in it, it implements the TabableView interface. Tabs will only be expanded if this view is embedded in a container that does tab expansion. ParagraphView is an example of a container that does tab expansion.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맍loat많etPartialSpan(int맗0,                     int맗1)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines the span along the same axis as tab expansion for a portion of the view. This is intended for use by the TabExpander for cases where the tab expansion involves aligning the portion of text that doesn't have whitespace relative to the tab stop. There is therefore an assumption that the range given does not contain tabs. This method can be called while servicing the getTabbedSpan or getPreferredSize. It has to arrange for its own text buffer to make the measurements.

				</name>
				<description>
					Determines how attractive a break opportunity in this view is. This can be used for determining which view is the most attractive to call breakView on in the process of formatting. The higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A value equal to or lower than View.BadBreakWeight should not be considered for a break. A value greater than or equal to View.ForcedBreakWeight should be broken. This is implemented to forward to the superclass for the Y_AXIS. Along the X_AXIS the following values may be returned. View.ExcellentBreakWeight if there is whitespace proceeding the desired break location. View.BadBreakWeight if the desired break location results in a break location of the starting offset. View.GoodBreakWeight if the other conditions don't occur. This will normally result in the behavior of breaking on a whitespace location if one can be found, otherwise breaking between characters.

				</name>
				<description>
					Breaks this view on the given axis at the given length. This is implemented to attempt to break on a whitespace location, and returns a fragment with the whitespace at the end. If a whitespace location can't be found, the nearest character is used.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicView맊reateFragment(int맗0,                    int맗1)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a view that represents a portion of the element. This is potentially useful during formatting operations for taking measurements of fragments of the view. If the view doesn't support fragmenting (the default), it should return itself. This view does support fragmenting. It is implemented to return a nested class that shares state in this view representing only a portion of the view.
