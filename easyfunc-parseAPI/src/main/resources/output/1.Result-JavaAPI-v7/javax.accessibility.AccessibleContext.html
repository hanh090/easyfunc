		<description>
			AccessibleContext represents the minimum information all accessible objects return. This information includes the accessible name, description, role, and state of the object, as well as information about its parent and children. AccessibleContext also contains methods for obtaining more specific accessibility information about a component. If the component supports them, these methods will return an object that implements one or more of the following interfaces: AccessibleAction - the object can perform one or more actions. This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine what those actions are and tell the object to perform them. Any object that can be manipulated should support this interface. AccessibleComponent - the object has a graphical representation. This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine and set the graphical representation of the object. Any object that is rendered on the screen should support this interface. AccessibleSelection - the object allows its children to be selected. This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine the currently selected children of the object as well as modify its selection set. Any object that has children that can be selected should support this interface. AccessibleText - the object presents editable textual information on the display. This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to access that text via its content, attributes, and spatial location. Any object that contains editable text should support this interface. AccessibleValue - the object supports a numerical value. This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine and set the current value of the object, as well as obtain its minimum and maximum values. Any object that supports a numerical value should support this interface.

				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the accessibleName property of this object. The accessibleName property of an object is a localized String that designates the purpose of the object. For example, the accessibleName property of a label or button might be the text of the label or button itself. In the case of an object that doesn't display its name, the accessibleName should still be set. For example, in the case of a text field used to enter the name of a city, the accessibleName for the en_US locale could be 'city.'
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맙etAccessibleName(String맙)

					publicString많etAccessibleDescription()
				</name>
				<description>

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractㅁccessibleRole많etAccessibleRole()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the role of this object. The role of the object is the generic purpose or use of the class of this object. For example, the role of a push button is AccessibleRole.PUSH_BUTTON. The roles in AccessibleRole are provided so component developers can pick from a set of predefined roles. This enables assistive technologies to provide a consistent interface to various tweaked subclasses of components (e.g., use AccessibleRole.PUSH_BUTTON for all components that act like a push button) as well as distinguish between sublasses that behave differently (e.g., AccessibleRole.CHECK_BOX for check boxes and AccessibleRole.RADIO_BUTTON for radio buttons). Note that the AccessibleRole class is also extensible, so custom component developers can define their own AccessibleRole's if the set of predefined roles is inadequate.
