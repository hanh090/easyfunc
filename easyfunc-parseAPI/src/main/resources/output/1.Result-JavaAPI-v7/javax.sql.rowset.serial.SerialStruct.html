		<description>
			A serialized mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL structured type. Each attribute that is not already serialized is mapped to a serialized form, and if an attribute is itself a structured type, each of its attributes that is not already serialized is mapped to a serialized form. In addition, the structured type is custom mapped to a class in the Java programming language if there is such a mapping, as are its attributes, if appropriate. The SerialStruct class provides a constructor for creating an instance from a Struct object, a method for retrieving the SQL type name of the SQL structured type in the database, and methods for retrieving its attribute values.

				<description>
					Constructs a SerialStruct object from the given SQLData object, using the given type map to custom map it to a class in the Java programming language. The type map gives the SQL type and the class to which it is mapped. The SQLData object defines the class to which the SQL type will be mapped.
