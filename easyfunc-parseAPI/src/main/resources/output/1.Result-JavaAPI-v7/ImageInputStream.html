		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					void setByteOrder(ByteOrder byteOrder)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the desired byte order for future reads of data values from this stream. For example, the sequence of bytes '0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04' if read as a 4-byte integer would have the value '0x01020304' using network byte order and the value '0x04030201' under the reverse byte order. The enumeration class java.nio.ByteOrder is used to specify the byte order. A value of ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN specifies so-called big-endian or network byte order, in which the high-order byte comes first. Motorola and Sparc processors store data in this format, while Intel processors store data in the reverse ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN order. The byte order has no effect on the results returned from the readBits method (or the value written by ImageOutputStream.writeBits).

					byte readByte()                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads a byte from the stream and returns it as a byte value. Byte values between 0x00 and 0x7f represent integer values between 0 and 127. Values between 0x80 and 0xff represent negative values from -128 to /1. The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before the read occurs.

				<name>
					int readUnsignedByte()                       throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads a byte from the stream, and (conceptually) converts it to an int, masks it with 0xff in order to strip off any sign-extension bits, and returns it as a byte value. Thus, byte values between 0x00 and 0x7f are simply returned as integer values between 0 and 127. Values between 0x80 and 0xff, which normally represent negative bytevalues, will be mapped into positive integers between 128 and 255. The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before the read occurs.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					String readLine()                  throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads the next line of text from the input stream. It reads successive bytes, converting each byte separately into a character, until it encounters a line terminator or end of file; the characters read are then returned as a String. Note that because this method processes bytes, it does not support input of the full Unicode character set. If end of file is encountered before even one byte can be read, then null is returned. Otherwise, each byte that is read is converted to type char by zero-extension. If the character '\n' is encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the character '\r' is encountered, it is discarded and, if the following byte converts to the character '\n', then that is discarded also; reading then ceases. If end of file is encountered before either of the characters '\n' and '\r' is encountered, reading ceases. Once reading has ceased, a String is returned that contains all the characters read and not discarded, taken in order. Note that every character in this string will have a value less than \u0100, that is, (char)256. The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before the read occurs.

			<method>
				<name>
					String readUTF()                 throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads in a string that has been encoded using a modified UTF-8 format. The general contract of readUTF is that it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is then returned as a String. First, two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned 16-bit integer in the manner of the readUnsignedShort method, using network byte order (regardless of the current byte order setting). This integer value is called the UTF length and specifies the number of additional bytes to be read. These bytes are then converted to characters by considering them in groups. The length of each group is computed from the value of the first byte of the group. The byte following a group, if any, is the first byte of the next group. If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern 0xxxxxxx (where x means "may be 0 or 1"), then the group consists of just that byte. The byte is zero-extended to form a character. If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern 110xxxxx, then the group consists of that byte a and a second byte b. If there is no byte b (because byte a was the last of the bytes to be read), or if byte b does not match the bit pattern 10xxxxxx, then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown. Otherwise, the group is converted to the character:    (char)(((a& 0x1F) << 6) | (b & 0x3F))   If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern 1110xxxx, then the group consists of that byte a and two more bytes b and c. If there is no byte c (because byte a was one of the last two of the bytes to be read), or either byte b or byte c does not match the bit pattern 10xxxxxx, then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown. Otherwise, the group is converted to the character:    (char)(((a & 0x0F) << 12) | ((b & 0x3F) << 6) | (c & 0x3F))   If the first byte of a group matches the pattern 1111xxxx or the pattern 10xxxxxx, then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown. If end of file is encountered at any time during this entire process, then an EOFException is thrown. After every group has been converted to a character by this process, the characters are gathered, in the same order in which their corresponding groups were read from the input stream, to form a String, which is returned. The current byte order setting is ignored. The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before the read occurs. Note: This method should not be used in the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8, because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with standard UTF-8.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int getBitOffset()                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the current bit offset, as an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive. The bit offset is updated implicitly by calls to the readBits method. A value of 0 indicates the most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least significant bit, of the byte being read. The bit offset is set to 0 when a stream is first opened, and is reset to 0 by calls to seek, skipBytes, or any read or readFully method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void setBitOffset(int bitOffset)                    throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the bit offset to an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive. The byte offset within the stream, as returned by getStreamPosition, is left unchanged. A value of 0 indicates the most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least significant bit, of the byte being read.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int readBit()              throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads a single bit from the stream and returns it as an int with the value 0 or 1. The bit offset is advanced by one and reduced modulo 8.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					long readBits(int numBits)                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads a bitstring from the stream and returns it as a long, with the first bit read becoming the most significant bit of the output. The read starts within the byte indicated by getStreamPosition, at the bit given by getBitOffset. The bit offset is advanced by numBits and reduced modulo 8. The byte order of the stream has no effect on this method. The return value of this method is constructed as though the bits were read one at a time, and shifted into the right side of the return value, as shown by the following pseudo-code:    long accum = 0L;   for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {     accum <<= 1; // Shift left one bit to make room     accum |= readBit();   }   Note that the result of readBits(32) may thus not be equal to that of readInt() if a reverse network byte order is being used (i.e., getByteOrder() == false). If the end of the stream is encountered before all the bits have been read, an EOFException is thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					long length()              throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the total length of the stream, if known. Otherwise, -1 is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int skipBytes(int n)                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes. It is possible that this method will only be able to skip forward by a smaller number of bytes than requested, for example if the end of the stream is reached. In all cases, the actual number of bytes skipped is returned. The bit offset is set to zero prior to advancing the position.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					long skipBytes(long n)                 throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes. This method is identical to skipBytes(int) except that it allows for a larger skip distance.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void seek(long pos)            throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the current stream position to the desired location. The next read will occur at this location. The bit offset is set to 0. An IndexOutOfBoundsException will be thrown if pos is smaller than the flushed position (as returned by getflushedPosition). It is legal to seek past the end of the file; an EOFException will be thrown only if a read is performed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void mark()
				</name>
				<description>
					Marks a position in the stream to be returned to by a subsequent call to reset. Unlike a standard InputStream, all ImageInputStreams support marking. Additionally, calls to mark and reset may be nested arbitrarily. Unlike the mark methods declared by the Reader and InputStream interfaces, no readLimit parameter is used. An arbitrary amount of data may be read following the call to mark. The bit position used by the readBits method is saved and restored by each pair of calls to mark and reset. Note that it is valid for an ImageReader to call flushBefore as part of a read operation. Therefore, if an application calls mark prior to passing that stream to an ImageReader, the application should not assume that the marked position will remain valid after the read operation has completed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void reset()             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the stream pointer to its previous position, including the bit offset, at the time of the most recent unmatched call to mark. Calls to reset without a corresponding call to mark have no effect. An IOException will be thrown if the previous marked position lies in the discarded portion of the stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void flushBefore(long pos)                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Discards the initial portion of the stream prior to the indicated postion. Attempting to seek to an offset within the flushed portion of the stream will result in an IndexOutOfBoundsException. Calling flushBefore may allow classes implementing this interface to free up resources such as memory or disk space that are being used to store data from the stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void flush()             throws IOException

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					long getFlushedPosition()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the earliest position in the stream to which seeking may be performed. The returned value will be the maximum of all values passed into previous calls to flushBefore.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean isCached()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this ImageInputStream caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards. Applications may consult this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush in order to conserve cache resources.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean isCachedMemory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this ImageInputStream caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and the cache is kept in main memory. Applications may consult this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush in order to conserve cache resources.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean isCachedFile()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this ImageInputStream caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and the cache is kept in a temporary file. Applications may consult this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush in order to conserve cache resources.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void close()             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Closes the stream. Attempts to access a stream that has been closed may result in IOExceptions or incorrect behavior. Calling this method may allow classes implementing this interface to release resources associated with the stream such as memory, disk space, or file descriptors.
