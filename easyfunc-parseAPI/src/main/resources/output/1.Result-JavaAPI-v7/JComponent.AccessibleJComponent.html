			public abstract class JComponent.AccessibleJComponent  extends Container.AccessibleAWTContainer  implements AccessibleExtendedComponent
		</name>
		<description>
			Inner class of JComponent used to provide default support for accessibility. This class is not meant to be used directly by application developers, but is instead meant only to be subclassed by component developers. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

					Though the class is abstract, this should be called by all sub-classes.

					public맜oidremovePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener맓istener)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes a PropertyChangeListener from the listener list. This removes a PropertyChangeListener that was registered for all properties.

			<method>
				<name>
					protectedString많etBorderTitle(Border막)
				</name>
				<description>
					Recursively search through the border hierarchy (if it exists) for a TitledBorder with a non-null title. This does a depth first search on first the inside borders then the outside borders. The assumption is that titles make really pretty inside borders but not very pretty outside borders in compound border situations. It's rather arbitrary, but hopefully decent UI programmers will not create multiple titled borders for the same component.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString많etAccessibleName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the accessible name of this object. This should almost never return java.awt.Component.getName(), as that generally isn't a localized name, and doesn't have meaning for the user. If the object is fundamentally a text object (such as a menu item), the accessible name should be the text of the object (for example, "save"). If the object has a tooltip, the tooltip text may also be an appropriate String to return.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString많etAccessibleDescription()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the accessible description of this object. This should be a concise, localized description of what this object is - what is its meaning to the user. If the object has a tooltip, the tooltip text may be an appropriate string to return, assuming it contains a concise description of the object (instead of just the name of the object - for example a "Save" icon on a toolbar that had "save" as the tooltip text shouldn't return the tooltip text as the description, but something like "Saves the current text document" instead).

			<method>

				<description>
					Returns the number of accessible children in the object. If all of the children of this object implement Accessible, than this method should return the number of children of this object.
