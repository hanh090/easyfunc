			public abstract class ImageWriter  extends Object  implements ImageTranscoder
		</name>
		<description>
			An abstract superclass for encoding and writing images. This class must be subclassed by classes that write out images in the context of the Java Image I/O framework. ImageWriter objects are normally instantiated by the service provider class for the specific format. Service provider classes are registered with the IIORegistry, which uses them for format recognition and presentation of available format readers and writers.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected List<IIOWriteWarningListener> warningListeners
				</name>
				<description>
					A List of currently registered IIOWriteWarningListeners, initialized by default to null, which is synonymous with an empty List.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected List<Locale> warningLocales
				</name>
				<description>
					A List of Locales, one for each element of warningListeners, initialized by default null, which is synonymous with an empty List.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected List<IIOWriteProgressListener> progressListeners
				</name>
				<description>
					A List of currently registered IIOWriteProgressListeners, initialized by default null, which is synonymous with an empty List.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected ImageWriter(ImageWriterSpi originatingProvider)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an ImageWriter and sets its originatingProvider instance variable to the supplied value. Subclasses that make use of extensions should provide a constructor with signature (ImageWriterSpi, Object) in order to retrieve the extension object. If the extension object is unsuitable, an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ImageWriterSpi getOriginatingProvider()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the ImageWriterSpi object that created this ImageWriter, or null if this object was not created through the IIORegistry. The default implementation returns the value of the originatingProvider instance variable.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setOutput(Object output)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the destination to the given ImageOutputStream or other Object. The destination is assumed to be ready to accept data, and will not be closed at the end of each write. This allows distributed imaging applications to transmit a series of images over a single network connection. If output is null, any currently set output will be removed. If output is an ImageOutputStream, calls to the write, writeToSequence, and prepareWriteEmpty/endWriteEmpty methods will preserve the existing contents of the stream. Other write methods, such as writeInsert, replaceStreamMetadata, replaceImageMetadata, replacePixels, prepareInsertEmpty/endInsertEmpty, and endWriteSequence, require the full contents of the stream to be readable and writable, and may alter any portion of the stream. Use of a general Object other than an ImageOutputStream is intended for writers that interact directly with an output device or imaging protocol. The set of legal classes is advertised by the writer's service provider's getOutputTypes method; most writers will return a single-element array containing only ImageOutputStream.class to indicate that they accept only an ImageOutputStream. The default implementation sets the output instance variable to the value of output after checking output against the set of classes advertised by the originating provider, if there is one.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object getOutput()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the ImageOutputStream or other Object set by the most recent call to the setOutput method. If no destination has been set, null is returned. The default implementation returns the value of the output instance variable.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Locale[] getAvailableLocales()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of Locales that may be used to localize warning listeners and compression settings. A return value of null indicates that localization is not supported. The default implementation returns a clone of the availableLocales instance variable if it is non-null, or else returns null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setLocale(Locale locale)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the current Locale of this ImageWriter to the given value. A value of null removes any previous setting, and indicates that the writer should localize as it sees fit. The default implementation checks locale against the values returned by getAvailableLocales, and sets the locale instance variable if it is found. If locale is null, the instance variable is set to null without any checking.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Locale getLocale()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the currently set Locale, or null if none has been set. The default implementation returns the value of the locale instance variable.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ImageWriteParam getDefaultWriteParam()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a new ImageWriteParam object of the appropriate type for this file format containing default values, that is, those values that would be used if no ImageWriteParam object were specified. This is useful as a starting point for tweaking just a few parameters and otherwise leaving the default settings alone. The default implementation constructs and returns a new ImageWriteParam object that does not allow tiling, progressive encoding, or compression, and that will be localized for the current Locale (i.e., what you would get by calling new ImageWriteParam(getLocale()). Individual plug-ins may return an instance of ImageWriteParam with additional optional features enabled, or they may return an instance of a plug-in specific subclass of ImageWriteParam.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract IIOMetadata getDefaultStreamMetadata(ImageWriteParam param)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an IIOMetadata object containing default values for encoding a stream of images. The contents of the object may be manipulated using either the XML tree structure returned by the IIOMetadata.getAsTree method, an IIOMetadataController object, or via plug-in specific interfaces, and the resulting data supplied to one of the write methods that take a stream metadata parameter. An optional ImageWriteParam may be supplied for cases where it may affect the structure of the stream metadata. If the supplied ImageWriteParam contains optional setting values not supported by this writer (e.g. progressive encoding or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored. Writers that do not make use of stream metadata (e.g., writers for single-image formats) should return null.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of thumbnails suported by the format being written, given the image type and any additional write parameters and metadata objects that will be used during encoding. A return value of -1 indicates that insufficient information is available. An ImageWriteParam may optionally be supplied for cases where it may affect thumbnail handling. If the supplied ImageWriteParam contains optional setting values not supported by this writer (e.g. progressive encoding or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored. The default implementation returns 0.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of Dimensions indicating the legal size ranges for thumbnail images as they will be encoded in the output file or stream. This information is merely advisory; the writer will resize any supplied thumbnails as necessary. The information is returned as a set of pairs; the first element of a pair contains an (inclusive) minimum width and height, and the second element contains an (inclusive) maximum width and height. Together, each pair defines a valid range of sizes. To specify a fixed size, the same width and height will appear for both elements. A return value of null indicates that the size is arbitrary or unknown. An ImageWriteParam may optionally be supplied for cases where it may affect thumbnail handling. If the supplied ImageWriteParam contains optional setting values not supported by this writer (e.g. progressive encoding or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored. The default implementation returns null.

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean canWriteRasters()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the methods that take an IIOImage parameter are capable of dealing with a Raster (as opposed to RenderedImage) source image. If this method returns false, then those methods will throw an UnsupportedOperationException if supplied with an IIOImage containing a Raster. The default implementation returns false.

				</name>
				<description>
					Appends a complete image stream containing a single image and associated stream and image metadata and thumbnails to the output. Any necessary header information is included. If the output is an ImageOutputStream, its existing contents prior to the current seek position are not affected, and need not be readable or writable. The output must have been set beforehand using the setOutput method. Stream metadata may optionally be supplied; if it is null, default stream metadata will be used. If canWriteRasters returns true, the IIOImage may contain a Raster source. Otherwise, it must contain a RenderedImage source. The supplied thumbnails will be resized if needed, and any thumbnails in excess of the supported number will be ignored. If the format requires additional thumbnails that are not provided, the writer should generate them internally. An ImageWriteParam may optionally be supplied to control the writing process. If param is null, a default write param will be used. If the supplied ImageWriteParam contains optional setting values not supported by this writer (e.g. progressive encoding or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored.

					public void write(RenderedImage image)             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends a complete image stream consisting of a single image with default metadata and thumbnails to the output. This method is a shorthand for write(null, new IIOImage(image, null, null), null).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean canWriteSequence()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the writer is able to append an image to an image stream that already contains header information and possibly prior images. If canWriteSequence returns false, writeToSequence and endWriteSequence will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. The default implementation returns false.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public void prepareWriteSequence(IIOMetadata streamMetadata)                            throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Prepares a stream to accept a series of subsequent writeToSequence calls, using the provided stream metadata object. The metadata will be written to the stream if it should precede the image data. If the argument is null, default stream metadata is used. If the output is an ImageOutputStream, the existing contents of the output prior to the current seek position are flushed, and need not be readable or writable. If the format requires that endWriteSequence be able to rewind to patch up the header information, such as for a sequence of images in a single TIFF file, then the metadata written by this method must remain in a writable portion of the stream. Other formats may flush the stream after this method and after each image. If canWriteSequence returns false, this method will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. The output must have been set beforehand using either the setOutput method. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

				</name>
				<description>
					Appends a single image and possibly associated metadata and thumbnails, to the output. If the output is an ImageOutputStream, the existing contents of the output prior to the current seek position may be flushed, and need not be readable or writable, unless the plug-in needs to be able to patch up the header information when endWriteSequence is called (e.g. TIFF). If canWriteSequence returns false, this method will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. The output must have been set beforehand using the setOutput method. prepareWriteSequence must have been called beforehand, or an IllegalStateException is thrown. If canWriteRasters returns true, the IIOImage may contain a Raster source. Otherwise, it must contain a RenderedImage source. The supplied thumbnails will be resized if needed, and any thumbnails in excess of the supported number will be ignored. If the format requires additional thumbnails that are not provided, the writer will generate them internally. An ImageWriteParam may optionally be supplied to control the writing process. If param is null, a default write param will be used. If the supplied ImageWriteParam contains optional setting values not supported by this writer (e.g. progressive encoding or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

				<name>
					public void endWriteSequence()                        throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Completes the writing of a sequence of images begun with prepareWriteSequence. Any stream metadata that should come at the end of the sequence of images is written out, and any header information at the beginning of the sequence is patched up if necessary. If the output is an ImageOutputStream, data through the stream metadata at the end of the sequence are flushed and need not be readable or writable. If canWriteSequence returns false, this method will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void replaceStreamMetadata(IIOMetadata streamMetadata)                             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Replaces the stream metadata in the output with new information. If the output is an ImageOutputStream, the prior contents of the stream are examined and possibly edited to make room for the new data. All of the prior contents of the output must be available for reading and writing. If canReplaceStreamMetadata returns false, an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if it is possible to replace the image metadata associated with an existing image with index imageIndex. If this method returns false, a call to replaceImageMetadata(imageIndex) will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. A writer that does not support any image metadata replacement may return false without performing bounds checking on the index. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise returns false without checking the value of imageIndex.

				</name>
				<description>
					Replaces the image metadata associated with an existing image. If canReplaceImageMetadata(imageIndex) returns false, an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

				<name>
					public boolean canInsertImage(int imageIndex)                         throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the writer supports the insertion of a new image at the given index. Existing images with indices greater than or equal to the insertion index will have their indices increased by 1. A value for imageIndex of -1 may be used to signify an index one larger than the current largest index. A writer that does not support any image insertion may return false without performing bounds checking on the index. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise returns false withour checking the value of imageIndex.

				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts a new image into an existing image stream. Existing images with an index greater than imageIndex are preserved, and their indices are each increased by 1. A value for imageIndex of -1 may be used to signify an index one larger than the previous largest index; that is, it will cause the image to be logically appended to the end of the sequence. If the output is an ImageOutputStream, the entirety of the stream must be both readable and writeable. If canInsertImage(imageIndex) returns false, an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown. An ImageWriteParam may optionally be supplied to control the writing process. If param is null, a default write param will be used. If the supplied ImageWriteParam contains optional setting values not supported by this writer (e.g. progressive encoding or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

					public boolean canRemoveImage(int imageIndex)                         throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the writer supports the removal of an existing image at the given index. Existing images with indices greater than the insertion index will have their indices decreased by 1. A writer that does not support any image removal may return false without performing bounds checking on the index. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise returns false without checking the value of imageIndex.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void removeImage(int imageIndex)                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes an image from the stream. If canRemoveImage(imageIndex) returns false, an UnsupportedOperationExceptionwill be thrown. The removal may or may not cause a reduction in the actual file size. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the writer supports the writing of a complete image stream consisting of a single image with undefined pixel values and associated metadata and thumbnails to the output. The pixel values may be defined by future calls to the replacePixels methods. If the output is an ImageOutputStream, its existing contents prior to the current seek position are not affected, and need not be readable or writable. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise returns false.

				</name>
				<description>
					Begins the writing of a complete image stream, consisting of a single image with undefined pixel values and associated metadata and thumbnails, to the output. The pixel values will be defined by future calls to the replacePixels methods. If the output is an ImageOutputStream, its existing contents prior to the current seek position are not affected, and need not be readable or writable. The writing is not complete until a call to endWriteEmpty occurs. Calls to prepareReplacePixels, replacePixels, and endReplacePixels may occur between calls to prepareWriteEmpty and endWriteEmpty. However, calls to prepareWriteEmpty cannot be nested, and calls to prepareWriteEmpty and prepareInsertEmpty may not be interspersed. If canWriteEmpty returns false, an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown. An ImageWriteParam may optionally be supplied to control the writing process. If param is null, a default write param will be used. If the supplied ImageWriteParam contains optional setting values not supported by this writer (e.g. progressive encoding or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

					Returns true if the writer supports the insertion of a new, empty image at the given index. The pixel values of the image are undefined, and may be specified in pieces using the replacePixels methods. Existing images with indices greater than or equal to the insertion index will have their indices increased by 1. A value for imageIndex of -1 may be used to signify an index one larger than the current largest index. A writer that does not support insertion of empty images may return false without performing bounds checking on the index. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise returns false without checking the value of imageIndex.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the writer allows pixels of the given image to be replaced using the replacePixels methods. A writer that does not support any pixel replacement may return false without performing bounds checking on the index. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise returns false without checking the value of imageIndex.

				</name>
				<description>
					Replaces a portion of an image already present in the output with a portion of the given image. The image data must match, or be convertible to, the image layout of the existing image. The destination region is specified in the param argument, and will be clipped to the image boundaries and the region supplied to prepareReplacePixels. At least one pixel of the source must not be clipped, or an exception is thrown. An ImageWriteParam may optionally be supplied to control the writing process. If param is null, a default write param will be used. If the supplied ImageWriteParam contains optional setting values not supported by this writer (e.g. progressive encoding or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored. This method may only be called after a call to prepareReplacePixels, or else an IllegalStateException will be thrown. The default implementation throws an IllegalStateException if the output is null, and otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException.
