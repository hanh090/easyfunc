		</name>
		<description>
			Icon decorator that implements the view interface. The entire element is used to represent the icon. This acts as a gateway from the display-only View implementations to interactive lightweight icons (that is, it allows icons to be embedded into the View hierarchy. The parent of the icon is the container that is handed out by the associated view factory.

					public맜oid맗aint(Graphics많,           Shape마)
				</name>
				<description>
					Paints the icon. The real paint behavior occurs naturally from the association that the icon has with its parent container (the same container hosting this view), so this simply allows us to position the icon properly relative to the view. Since the coordinate system for the view is simply the parent containers, positioning the child icon is easy.
