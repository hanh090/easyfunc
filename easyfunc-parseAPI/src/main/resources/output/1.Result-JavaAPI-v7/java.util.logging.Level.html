			public class Level  extends Object  implements Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			The Level class defines a set of standard logging levels that can be used to control logging output. The logging Level objects are ordered and are specified by ordered integers. Enabling logging at a given level also enables logging at all higher levels. Clients should normally use the predefined Level constants such as Level.SEVERE. The levels in descending order are: SEVERE (highest value) WARNING INFO CONFIG FINE FINER FINEST (lowest value) In addition there is a level OFF that can be used to turn off logging, and a level ALL that can be used to enable logging of all messages. It is possible for third parties to define additional logging levels by subclassing Level. In such cases subclasses should take care to chose unique integer level values and to ensure that they maintain the Object uniqueness property across serialization by defining a suitable readResolve method.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalLevel OFF
				</name>
				<description>
					OFF is a special level that can be used to turn off logging. This level is initialized to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalLevel SEVERE
				</name>
				<description>
					SEVERE is a message level indicating a serious failure. In general SEVERE messages should describe events that are of considerable importance and which will prevent normal program execution. They should be reasonably intelligible to end users and to system administrators. This level is initialized to 1000.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalLevel WARNING
				</name>
				<description>
					WARNING is a message level indicating a potential problem. In general WARNING messages should describe events that will be of interest to end users or system managers, or which indicate potential problems. This level is initialized to 900.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalLevel INFO
				</name>
				<description>
					INFO is a message level for informational messages. Typically INFO messages will be written to the console or its equivalent. So the INFO level should only be used for reasonably significant messages that will make sense to end users and system administrators. This level is initialized to 800.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalLevel CONFIG
				</name>
				<description>
					CONFIG is a message level for static configuration messages. CONFIG messages are intended to provide a variety of static configuration information, to assist in debugging problems that may be associated with particular configurations. For example, CONFIG message might include the CPU type, the graphics depth, the GUI look-and-feel, etc. This level is initialized to 700.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalLevel FINE
				</name>
				<description>
					FINE is a message level providing tracing information. All of FINE, FINER, and FINEST are intended for relatively detailed tracing. The exact meaning of the three levels will vary between subsystems, but in general, FINEST should be used for the most voluminous detailed output, FINER for somewhat less detailed output, and FINE for the lowest volume (and most important) messages. In general the FINE level should be used for information that will be broadly interesting to developers who do not have a specialized interest in the specific subsystem. FINE messages might include things like minor (recoverable) failures. Issues indicating potential performance problems are also worth logging as FINE. This level is initialized to 500.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalLevel FINER
				</name>
				<description>
					FINER indicates a fairly detailed tracing message. By default logging calls for entering, returning, or throwing an exception are traced at this level. This level is initialized to 400.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalLevel FINEST
				</name>
				<description>
					FINEST indicates a highly detailed tracing message. This level is initialized to 300.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static finalLevel ALL
				</name>
				<description>
					ALL indicates that all messages should be logged. This level is initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedLevel(String맕ame,       int맜alue)
				</name>
				<description>
					Create a named Level with a given integer value. Note that this constructor is "protected" to allow subclassing. In general clients of logging should use one of the constant Level objects such as SEVERE or FINEST. However, if clients need to add new logging levels, they may subclass Level and define new constants.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedLevel(String맕ame,       int맜alue,       StringresourceBundleName)
				</name>
				<description>
					Create a named Level with a given integer value and a given localization resource name.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString많etResourceBundleName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the level's localization resource bundle name, or null if no localization bundle is defined.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString많etName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the non-localized string name of the Level.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString많etLocalizedName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the localized string name of the Level, for the current default locale. If no localization information is available, the non-localized name is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public finalString맚oString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this Level.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final말nt말ntValue()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the integer value for this level. This integer value can be used for efficient ordering comparisons between Level objects.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public staticLevel맗arse(String맕ame)                     throws IllegalArgumentException
				</name>
				<description>
					Parse a level name string into a Level. The argument string may consist of either a level name or an integer value. For example: "SEVERE" "1000"
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean만quals(Object맖x)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compare two objects for value equality.
