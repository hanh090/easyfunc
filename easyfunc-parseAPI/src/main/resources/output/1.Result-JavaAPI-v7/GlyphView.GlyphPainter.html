			public abstract static class GlyphView.GlyphPainter  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			A class to perform rendering of the glyphs. This can be implemented to be stateless, or to hold some information as a cache to facilitate faster rendering and model/view translation. At a minimum, the GlyphPainter allows a View implementation to perform its duties independant of a particular version of JVM and selection of capabilities (i.e. shaping for i18n, etc).

				<description>
					Determines the model location that represents the maximum advance that fits within the given span. This could be used to break the given view. The result should be a location just shy of the given advance. This differs from viewToModel which returns the closest position which might be proud of the maximum advance.

				<description>
					Create a painter to use for the given GlyphView. If the painter carries state it can create another painter to represent a new GlyphView that is being created. If the painter doesn't hold any significant state, it can return itself. The default behavior is to return itself.

				<description>
					Provides a way to determine the next visually represented model location that one might place a caret. Some views may not be visible, they might not be in the same order found in the model, or they just might not allow access to some of the locations in the model.
