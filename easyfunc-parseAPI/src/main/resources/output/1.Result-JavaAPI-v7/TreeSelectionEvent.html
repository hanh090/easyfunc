			public class TreeSelectionEvent  extends EventObject
		</name>
		<description>
			An event that characterizes a change in the current selection. The change is based on any number of paths. TreeSelectionListeners will generally query the source of the event for the new selected status of each potentially changed row. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
