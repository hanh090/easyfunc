			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt REQUIRES_ATTENTION
				</name>
				<description>
					The print service indicates that a - possibly transient - problem may require external intervention before the print service can continue. One example of an event that can generate this message is when the printer runs out of paper.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt NO_MORE_EVENTS
				</name>
				<description>
					Not all print services may be capable of delivering interesting events, or even telling when a job is complete. This message indicates the print job has no further information or communication with the print service. This message should always be delivered if a terminal event (completed/failed/canceled) is not delivered. For example, if messages such as JOB_COMPLETE have NOT been received before receiving this message, the only inference that should be drawn is that the print service does not support delivering such an event.
