		<description>
			A collection of unique attributes. This is a read-only, immutable interface. An attribute is basically a key and a value assigned to the key. The collection may represent something like a style run, a logical style, etc. These are generally used to describe features that will contribute to some graphical representation such as a font. The set of possible keys is unbounded and can be anything. Typically View implementations will respond to attribute definitions and render something to represent the attributes. Attributes can potentially resolve in a hierarchy. If a key doesn't resolve locally, and a resolving parent exists, the key will be resolved through the parent.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					static finalObject NameAttribute
				</name>
				<description>
					Attribute name used to name the collection of attributes.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					static finalObject ResolveAttribute
				</name>
				<description>
					Attribute name used to identify the resolving parent set of attributes, if one is defined.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int많etAttributeCount()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of attributes that are defined locally in this set. Attributes that are defined in the parent set are not included.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean말sDefined(Object마ttrName)
				</name>
				<description>
					Checks whether the named attribute has a value specified in the set without resolving through another attribute set.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean말sEqual(AttributeSet마ttr)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines if the two attribute sets are equivalent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					AttributeSet맊opyAttributes()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an attribute set that is guaranteed not to change over time.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Object많etAttribute(Object맒ey)
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches the value of the given attribute. If the value is not found locally, the search is continued upward through the resolving parent (if one exists) until the value is either found or there are no more parents. If the value is not found, null is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Enumeration<?>많etAttributeNames()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an enumeration over the names of the attributes that are defined locally in the set. Names of attributes defined in the resolving parent, if any, are not included. The values of the Enumeration may be anything and are not constrained to a particular Object type. This method never returns null. For a set with no attributes, it returns an empty Enumeration.

			<method>
				<name>
					boolean맊ontainsAttribute(Object맕ame,                          Object맜alue)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this set defines an attribute with the same name and an equal value. If such an attribute is not found locally, it is searched through in the resolving parent hierarchy.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean맊ontainsAttributes(AttributeSet마ttributes)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this set defines all the attributes from the given set with equal values. If an attribute is not found locally, it is searched through in the resolving parent hierarchy.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					AttributeSet많etResolveParent()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the resolving parent.
