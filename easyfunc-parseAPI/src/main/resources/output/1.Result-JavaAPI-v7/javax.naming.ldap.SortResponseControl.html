			public final class SortResponseControl  extends BasicControl
		</name>
		<description>
			Indicates whether the requested sort of search results was successful or not. When the result code indicates success then the results have been sorted as requested. Otherwise the sort was unsuccessful and additional details regarding the cause of the error may have been provided by the server. The code sample in SortControl shows how this class may be used. This class implements the LDAPv3 Response Control for server-side sorting as defined in RFC 2891. The control's value has the following ASN.1 definition:          SortResult ::= SEQUENCE {          sortResult  ENUMERATED {              success                   (0), -- results are sorted              operationsError           (1), -- server internal failure              timeLimitExceeded         (3), -- timelimit reached before                                             -- sorting was completed              strongAuthRequired        (8), -- refused to return sorted                                             -- results via insecure                                             -- protocol              adminLimitExceeded       (11), -- too many matching entries                                             -- for the server to sort              noSuchAttribute          (16), -- unrecognized attribute                                             -- type in sort key              inappropriateMatching    (18), -- unrecognized or inappro-                                             -- priate matching rule in                                             -- sort key              insufficientAccessRights (50), -- refused to return sorted                                             -- results to this client              busy                     (51), -- too busy to process              unwillingToPerform       (53), -- unable to sort              other                    (80)              },        attributeType [0] AttributeType OPTIONAL }
