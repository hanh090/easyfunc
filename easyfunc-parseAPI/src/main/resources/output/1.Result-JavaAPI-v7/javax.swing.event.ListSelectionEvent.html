			public class ListSelectionEvent  extends EventObject
		</name>
		<description>
			An event that characterizes a change in selection. The change is limited to a a single inclusive interval. The selection of at least one index within the range will have changed. A decent ListSelectionModel implementation will keep the range as small as possible. ListSelectionListeners will generally query the source of the event for the new selected status of each potentially changed row. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
