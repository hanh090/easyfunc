		<description>
			An event which indicates a change to the Component hierarchy to which Component belongs. Hierarchy Change Events (HierarchyListener) addition of an ancestor removal of an ancestor hierarchy made displayable hierarchy made undisplayable hierarchy shown on the screen (both visible and displayable) hierarchy hidden on the screen (either invisible or undisplayable) Ancestor Reshape Events (HierarchyBoundsListener) an ancestor was resized an ancestor was moved Hierarchy events are provided for notification purposes ONLY. The AWT will automatically handle changes to the hierarchy internally so that GUI layout and displayability works properly regardless of whether a program is receiving these events or not. This event is generated by a Container object (such as a Panel) when the Container is added, removed, moved, or resized, and passed down the hierarchy. It is also generated by a Component object when that object's addNotify, removeNotify, show, or hide method is called. The ANCESTOR_MOVED and ANCESTOR_RESIZED events are dispatched to every HierarchyBoundsListener or HierarchyBoundsAdapter object which registered to receive such events using the Component's addHierarchyBoundsListener method. (HierarchyBoundsAdapter objects implement the HierarchyBoundsListener interface.) The HIERARCHY_CHANGED events are dispatched to every HierarchyListener object which registered to receive such events using the Component's addHierarchyListener method. Each such listener object gets this HierarchyEvent when the event occurs. An unspecified behavior will be caused if the id parameter of any particular HierarchyEvent instance is not in the range from HIERARCHY_FIRST to HIERARCHY_LAST. The changeFlags parameter of any HierarchyEvent instance takes one of the following values: HierarchyEvent.PARENT_CHANGED HierarchyEvent.DISPLAYABILITY_CHANGED HierarchyEvent.SHOWING_CHANGED Assigning the value different from listed above will cause unspecified behavior.

					Marks the first integer id for the range of hierarchy event ids.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt HIERARCHY_CHANGED
				</name>
				<description>
					The event id indicating that modification was made to the entire hierarchy tree.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt ANCESTOR_MOVED
				</name>
				<description>
					The event id indicating an ancestor-Container was moved.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt ANCESTOR_RESIZED
				</name>
				<description>
					The event id indicating an ancestor-Container was resized.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt HIERARCHY_LAST
				</name>
				<description>
					Marks the last integer id for the range of ancestor event ids.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt PARENT_CHANGED
				</name>
				<description>
					A change flag indicates that the HIERARCHY_CHANGED event was generated by a reparenting operation.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt DISPLAYABILITY_CHANGED
				</name>
				<description>
					A change flag indicates that the HIERARCHY_CHANGED event was generated due to the changing of the hierarchy displayability. To discern the current displayability of the hierarchy, call the Component.isDisplayable method. Displayability changes occur in response to explicit or implicit calls of the Component.addNotify and Component.removeNotify methods.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt SHOWING_CHANGED
				</name>
				<description>
					A change flag indicates that the HIERARCHY_CHANGED event was generated due to the changing of the hierarchy showing state. To discern the current showing state of the hierarchy, call the Component.isShowing method. Showing state changes occur when either the displayability or visibility of the hierarchy occurs. Visibility changes occur in response to explicit or implicit calls of the Component.show and Component.hide methods.

				<description>
					Constructs an HierarchyEvent object to identify a change in the Component hierarchy. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null.

					Constructs an HierarchyEvent object to identify a change in the Component hierarchy. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null.

			<method>

					publicComponent많etComponent()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the originator of the event.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					publicComponent많etChanged()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the Component at the top of the hierarchy which was changed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicContainer많etChangedParent()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the parent of the Component returned by getChanged(). For a HIERARCHY_CHANGED event where the change was of type PARENT_CHANGED via a call to Container.add, the parent returned is the parent after the add operation. For a HIERARCHY_CHANGED event where the change was of type PARENT_CHANGED via a call to Container.remove, the parent returned is the parent before the remove operation. For all other events and types, the parent returned is the parent during the operation.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맓ong많etChangeFlags()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a bitmask which indicates the type(s) of HIERARCHY_CHANGED events represented in this event object. The bits have been bitwise-ored together.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString맗aramString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a parameter string identifying this event. This method is useful for event-logging and for debugging.
