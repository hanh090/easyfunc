		<description>
			A Frame is a top-level window with a title and a border. The size of the frame includes any area designated for the border. The dimensions of the border area may be obtained using the getInsets method, however, since these dimensions are platform-dependent, a valid insets value cannot be obtained until the frame is made displayable by either calling pack or show. Since the border area is included in the overall size of the frame, the border effectively obscures a portion of the frame, constraining the area available for rendering and/or displaying subcomponents to the rectangle which has an upper-left corner location of (insets.left, insets.top), and has a size of width - (insets.left + insets.right) by height - (insets.top + insets.bottom). The default layout for a frame is BorderLayout. A frame may have its native decorations (i.e. Frame and Titlebar) turned off with setUndecorated. This can only be done while the frame is not displayable. In a multi-screen environment, you can create a Frame on a different screen device by constructing the Frame with Frame(GraphicsConfiguration) or Frame(String title, GraphicsConfiguration). The GraphicsConfiguration object is one of the GraphicsConfiguration objects of the target screen device. In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the desktop area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds of all configurations are relative to the virtual-coordinate system. The origin of the virtual-coordinate system is at the upper left-hand corner of the primary physical screen. Depending on the location of the primary screen in the virtual device, negative coordinates are possible, as shown in the following figure. In such an environment, when calling setLocation, you must pass a virtual coordinate to this method. Similarly, calling getLocationOnScreen on a Frame returns virtual device coordinates. Call the getBounds method of a GraphicsConfiguration to find its origin in the virtual coordinate system. The following code sets the location of the Frame at (10, 10) relative to the origin of the physical screen of the corresponding GraphicsConfiguration. If the bounds of the GraphicsConfiguration is not taken into account, the Frame location would be set at (10, 10) relative to the virtual-coordinate system and would appear on the primary physical screen, which might be different from the physical screen of the specified GraphicsConfiguration.         Frame f = new Frame(GraphicsConfiguration gc);        Rectangle bounds = gc.getBounds();        f.setLocation(10 + bounds.x, 10 + bounds.y);   Frames are capable of generating the following types of WindowEvents: WINDOW_OPENED WINDOW_CLOSING: If the program doesn't explicitly hide or dispose the window while processing this event, the window close operation is canceled. WINDOW_CLOSED WINDOW_ICONIFIED WINDOW_DEICONIFIED WINDOW_ACTIVATED WINDOW_DEACTIVATED WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED

					public Image getIconImage()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the image to be displayed as the icon for this frame. This method is obsolete and kept for backward compatibility only. Use Window.getIconImages() instead. If a list of several images was specified as a Window's icon, this method will return the first item of the list.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setIconImage(Image image)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the image to be displayed as the icon for this window. This method can be used instead of setIconImages() to specify a single image as a window's icon. The following statement:        setIconImage(image);   is equivalent to:        ArrayList<Image> imageList = new ArrayList<Image>();       imageList.add(image);       setIconImages(imageList);   Note : Native windowing systems may use different images of differing dimensions to represent a window, depending on the context (e.g. window decoration, window list, taskbar, etc.). They could also use just a single image for all contexts or no image at all.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setState(int state)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the state of this frame (obsolete). In older versions of JDK a frame state could only be NORMAL or ICONIFIED. Since JDK 1.4 set of supported frame states is expanded and frame state is represented as a bitwise mask. For compatibility with applications developed earlier this method still accepts Frame.NORMAL and Frame.ICONIFIED only. The iconic state of the frame is only changed, other aspects of frame state are not affected by this method. If the state passed to this method is neither Frame.NORMAL nor Frame.ICONIFIED the method performs no actions at all. Note that if the state is not supported on a given platform, neither the state nor the return value of the getState() method will be changed. The application may determine whether a specific state is supported via the Toolkit.isFrameStateSupported(int) method. If the frame is currently visible on the screen (the Window.isShowing() method returns true), the developer should examine the return value of the WindowEvent.getNewState() method of the WindowEvent received through the WindowStateListener to determine that the state has actually been changed. If the frame is not visible on the screen, the events may or may not be generated. In this case the developer may assume that the state changes immediately after this method returns. Later, when the setVisible(true) method is invoked, the frame will attempt to apply this state. Receiving any WindowEvent.WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED events is not guaranteed in this case also.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setExtendedState(int state)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the state of this frame. The state is represented as a bitwise mask. NORMAL Indicates that no state bits are set. ICONIFIED MAXIMIZED_HORIZ MAXIMIZED_VERT MAXIMIZED_BOTH Concatenates MAXIMIZED_HORIZ and MAXIMIZED_VERT. Note that if the state is not supported on a given platform, neither the state nor the return value of the getExtendedState() method will be changed. The application may determine whether a specific state is supported via the Toolkit.isFrameStateSupported(int) method. If the frame is currently visible on the screen (the Window.isShowing() method returns true), the developer should examine the return value of the WindowEvent.getNewState() method of the WindowEvent received through the WindowStateListener to determine that the state has actually been changed. If the frame is not visible on the screen, the events may or may not be generated. In this case the developer may assume that the state changes immediately after this method returns.

					public int getState()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the state of this frame (obsolete). In older versions of JDK a frame state could only be NORMAL or ICONIFIED. Since JDK 1.4 set of supported frame states is expanded and frame state is represented as a bitwise mask. For compatibility with old programs this method still returns Frame.NORMAL and Frame.ICONIFIED but it only reports the iconic state of the frame, other aspects of frame state are not reported by this method.

					public int getExtendedState()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the state of this frame. The state is represented as a bitwise mask. NORMAL Indicates that no state bits are set. ICONIFIED MAXIMIZED_HORIZ MAXIMIZED_VERT MAXIMIZED_BOTH Concatenates MAXIMIZED_HORIZ and MAXIMIZED_VERT.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setMaximizedBounds(Rectangle bounds)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the maximized bounds for this frame. When a frame is in maximized state the system supplies some defaults bounds. This method allows some or all of those system supplied values to be overridden. If bounds is null, accept bounds supplied by the system. If non-null you can override some of the system supplied values while accepting others by setting those fields you want to accept from system to Integer.MAX_VALUE. Note, the given maximized bounds are used as a hint for the native system, because the underlying platform may not support setting the location and/or size of the maximized windows. If that is the case, the provided values do not affect the appearance of the frame in the maximized state.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Rectangle getMaximizedBounds()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets maximized bounds for this frame. Some fields may contain Integer.MAX_VALUE to indicate that system supplied values for this field must be used.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setUndecorated(boolean undecorated)
				</name>
				<description>
					Disables or enables decorations for this frame. This method can only be called while the frame is not displayable. To make this frame decorated, it must be opaque and have the default shape, otherwise the IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. Refer to Window.setShape(java.awt.Shape), Window.setOpacity(float) and Window.setBackground(java.awt.Color) for details
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isUndecorated()
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates whether this frame is undecorated. By default, all frames are initially decorated.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setOpacity(float opacity)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the opacity of the window. The opacity value is in the range [0..1]. Note that setting the opacity level of 0 may or may not disable the mouse event handling on this window. This is a platform-dependent behavior. The following conditions must be met in order to set the opacity value less than 1.0f: The TRANSLUCENT translucency must be supported by the underlying system The window must be undecorated (see setUndecorated(boolean) and Dialog.setUndecorated(boolean)) The window must not be in full-screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window)) If the requested opacity value is less than 1.0f, and any of the above conditions are not met, the window opacity will not change, and the IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. The translucency levels of individual pixels may also be effected by the alpha component of their color (see Window.setBackground(Color)) and the current shape of this window (see Window.setShape(Shape)).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setShape(Shape shape)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the shape of the window. Setting a shape cuts off some parts of the window. Only the parts that belong to the given Shape remain visible and clickable. If the shape argument is null, this method restores the default shape, making the window rectangular on most platforms. The following conditions must be met to set a non-null shape: The PERPIXEL_TRANSPARENT translucency must be supported by the underlying system The window must be undecorated (see setUndecorated(boolean) and Dialog.setUndecorated(boolean)) The window must not be in full-screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window)) If the requested shape is not null, and any of the above conditions are not met, the shape of this window will not change, and either the UnsupportedOperationException or IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. The tranlucency levels of individual pixels may also be effected by the alpha component of their color (see Window.setBackground(Color)) and the opacity value (see Window.setOpacity(float)). See GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency for more details.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setBackground(Color bgColor)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the background color of this window. If the windowing system supports the PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT tranclucency, the alpha component of the given background color may effect the mode of operation for this window: it indicates whether this window must be opaque (alpha equals 1.0f) or per-pixel translucent (alpha is less than 1.0f). If the given background color is null, the window is considered completely opaque. All the following conditions must be met to enable the per-pixel transparency mode for this window: The PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT translucency must be supported by the graphics device where this window is located The window must be undecorated (see setUndecorated(boolean) and Dialog.setUndecorated(boolean)) The window must not be in full-screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window)) If the alpha component of the requested background color is less than 1.0f, and any of the above conditions are not met, the background color of this window will not change, the alpha component of the given background color will not affect the mode of operation for this window, and either the UnsupportedOperationException or IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. When the window is per-pixel translucent, the drawing sub-system respects the alpha value of each individual pixel. If a pixel gets painted with the alpha color component equal to zero, it becomes visually transparent. If the alpha of the pixel is equal to 1.0f, the pixel is fully opaque. Interim values of the alpha color component make the pixel semi-transparent. In this mode, the background of the window gets painted with the alpha value of the given background color. If the alpha value of the argument of this method is equal to 0, the background is not painted at all. The actual level of translucency of a given pixel also depends on window opacity (see Window.setOpacity(float)), as well as the current shape of this window (see Window.setShape(Shape)). Note that painting a pixel with the alpha value of 0 may or may not disable the mouse event handling on this pixel. This is a platform-dependent behavior. To make sure the mouse events do not get dispatched to a particular pixel, the pixel must be excluded from the shape of the window. Enabling the per-pixel translucency mode may change the graphics configuration of this window due to the native platform requirements.
