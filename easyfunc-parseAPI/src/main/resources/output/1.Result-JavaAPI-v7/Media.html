		<description>
			Class Media is a printing attribute class that specifies the medium on which to print. Media may be specified in different ways. it may be specified by paper source - eg paper tray it may be specified by a standard size - eg "A4" it may be specified by a name - eg "letterhead" Each of these corresponds to the IPP "media" attribute. The current API does not support describing media by characteristics (eg colour, opacity). This may be supported in a later revision of the specification. A Media object is constructed with a value which represents one of the ways in which the Media attribute can be specified. IPP Compatibility: The category name returned by getName() is the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value. The toString() method returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value.
