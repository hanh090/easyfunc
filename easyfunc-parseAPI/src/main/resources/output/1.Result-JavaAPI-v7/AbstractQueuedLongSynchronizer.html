			public abstract class AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer  extends AbstractOwnableSynchronizer  implements Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			A version of AbstractQueuedSynchronizer in which synchronization state is maintained as a long. This class has exactly the same structure, properties, and methods as AbstractQueuedSynchronizer with the exception that all state-related parameters and results are defined as long rather than int. This class may be useful when creating synchronizers such as multilevel locks and barriers that require 64 bits of state. See AbstractQueuedSynchronizer for usage notes and examples.

				<description>
					Atomically sets synchronization state to the given updated value if the current state value equals the expected value. This operation has memory semantics of a volatile read and write.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected막oolean맚ryAcquire(long마rg)
				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to acquire in exclusive mode. This method should query if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the exclusive mode, and if so to acquire it. This method is always invoked by the thread performing acquire. If this method reports failure, the acquire method may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is signalled by a release from some other thread. This can be used to implement method Lock.tryLock(). The default implementation throws UnsupportedOperationException.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected막oolean맚ryRelease(long마rg)
				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to set the state to reflect a release in exclusive mode. This method is always invoked by the thread performing release. The default implementation throws UnsupportedOperationException.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected맓ong맚ryAcquireShared(long마rg)
				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to acquire in shared mode. This method should query if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the shared mode, and if so to acquire it. This method is always invoked by the thread performing acquire. If this method reports failure, the acquire method may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is signalled by a release from some other thread. The default implementation throws UnsupportedOperationException.

				<description>
					Attempts to set the state to reflect a release in shared mode. This method is always invoked by the thread performing release. The default implementation throws UnsupportedOperationException.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected막oolean말sHeldExclusively()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if synchronization is held exclusively with respect to the current (calling) thread. This method is invoked upon each call to a non-waiting AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject method. (Waiting methods instead invoke release(long).) The default implementation throws UnsupportedOperationException. This method is invoked internally only within AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject methods, so need not be defined if conditions are not used.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final맜oid마cquire(long마rg)
				</name>
				<description>
					Acquires in exclusive mode, ignoring interrupts. Implemented by invoking at least once tryAcquire(long), returning on success. Otherwise the thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking tryAcquire(long) until success. This method can be used to implement method Lock.lock().
				</description>

				</name>
				<description>
					Acquires in exclusive mode, aborting if interrupted. Implemented by first checking interrupt status, then invoking at least once tryAcquire(long), returning on success. Otherwise the thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking tryAcquire(long) until success or the thread is interrupted. This method can be used to implement method Lock.lockInterruptibly().

				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to acquire in exclusive mode, aborting if interrupted, and failing if the given timeout elapses. Implemented by first checking interrupt status, then invoking at least once tryAcquire(long), returning on success. Otherwise, the thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking tryAcquire(long) until success or the thread is interrupted or the timeout elapses. This method can be used to implement method Lock.tryLock(long, TimeUnit).

				</name>
				<description>
					Acquires in shared mode, ignoring interrupts. Implemented by first invoking at least once tryAcquireShared(long), returning on success. Otherwise the thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking tryAcquireShared(long) until success.

				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to acquire in shared mode, aborting if interrupted, and failing if the given timeout elapses. Implemented by first checking interrupt status, then invoking at least once tryAcquireShared(long), returning on success. Otherwise, the thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking tryAcquireShared(long) until success or the thread is interrupted or the timeout elapses.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final막ooleanreleaseShared(long마rg)
				</name>
				<description>
					Releases in shared mode. Implemented by unblocking one or more threads if tryReleaseShared(long) returns true.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final막oolean맏asQueuedThreads()
				</name>
				<description>
					Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire. Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and timeouts may occur at any time, a true return does not guarantee that any other thread will ever acquire. In this implementation, this operation returns in constant time.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final막oolean맏asContended()
				</name>
				<description>
					Queries whether any threads have ever contended to acquire this synchronizer; that is if an acquire method has ever blocked. In this implementation, this operation returns in constant time.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public finalThread많etFirstQueuedThread()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the first (longest-waiting) thread in the queue, or null if no threads are currently queued. In this implementation, this operation normally returns in constant time, but may iterate upon contention if other threads are concurrently modifying the queue.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final막oolean말sQueued(Thread맚hread)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the given thread is currently queued. This implementation traverses the queue to determine presence of the given thread.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final막oolean맏asQueuedPredecessors()
				</name>
				<description>
					Queries whether any threads have been waiting to acquire longer than the current thread. An invocation of this method is equivalent to (but may be more efficient than):  getFirstQueuedThread() != Thread.currentThread() &&   hasQueuedThreads() Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and timeouts may occur at any time, a true return does not guarantee that some other thread will acquire before the current thread. Likewise, it is possible for another thread to win a race to enqueue after this method has returned false, due to the queue being empty. This method is designed to be used by a fair synchronizer to avoid barging. Such a synchronizer's tryAcquire(long) method should return false, and its tryAcquireShared(long) method should return a negative value, if this method returns true (unless this is a reentrant acquire). For example, the tryAcquire method for a fair, reentrant, exclusive mode synchronizer might look like this:  protected boolean tryAcquire(int arg) {     if (isHeldExclusively()) {       // A reentrant acquire; increment hold count       return true;     } else if (hasQueuedPredecessors()) {       return false;     } else {       // try to acquire normally     }   }
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final말nt많etQueueLength()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire. The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal data structures. This method is designed for use in monitoring system state, not for synchronization control.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public finalCollection<Thread>많etQueuedThreads()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire. Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular order. This method is designed to facilitate construction of subclasses that provide more extensive monitoring facilities.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public finalCollection<Thread>많etExclusiveQueuedThreads()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire in exclusive mode. This has the same properties as getQueuedThreads() except that it only returns those threads waiting due to an exclusive acquire.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public finalCollection<Thread>많etSharedQueuedThreads()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire in shared mode. This has the same properties as getQueuedThreads() except that it only returns those threads waiting due to a shared acquire.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicString맚oString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string identifying this synchronizer, as well as its state. The state, in brackets, includes the String "State =" followed by the current value of getState(), and either "nonempty" or "empty" depending on whether the queue is empty.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final막oolean맖wns(AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject맊ondition)
				</name>
				<description>
					Queries whether the given ConditionObject uses this synchronizer as its lock.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final막oolean맏asWaiters(AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject맊ondition)
				</name>
				<description>
					Queries whether any threads are waiting on the given condition associated with this synchronizer. Note that because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, a true return does not guarantee that a future signal will awaken any threads. This method is designed primarily for use in monitoring of the system state.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final말nt많etWaitQueueLength(AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject맊ondition)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the given condition associated with this synchronizer. Note that because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, the estimate serves only as an upper bound on the actual number of waiters. This method is designed for use in monitoring of the system state, not for synchronization control.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public finalCollection<Thread>많etWaitingThreads(AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject맊ondition)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a collection containing those threads that may be waiting on the given condition associated with this synchronizer. Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular order.
