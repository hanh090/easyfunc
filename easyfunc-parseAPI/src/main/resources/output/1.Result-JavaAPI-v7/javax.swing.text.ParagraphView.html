			public class ParagraphView  extends FlowView  implements TabExpander
		</name>
		<description>
			View of a simple line-wrapping paragraph that supports multiple fonts, colors, components, icons, etc. It is basically a vertical box with a margin around it. The contents of the box are a bunch of rows which are special horizontal boxes. This view creates a collection of views that represent the child elements of the paragraph element. Each of these views are placed into a row directly if they will fit, otherwise the breakView method is called to try and carve the view into pieces that fit.

					protected말nt많etLayoutViewCount()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of views that this view is responsible for. The child views of the paragraph are rows which have been used to arrange pieces of the Views that represent the child elements. This is the number of views that have been tiled in two dimensions, and should be equivalent to the number of child elements to the element this view is responsible for.

				<description>
					Returns the view at a given index. The child views of the paragraph are rows which have been used to arrange pieces of the Views that represent the child elements. This methods returns the view responsible for the child element index (prior to breaking). These are the Views that were produced from a factory (to represent the child elements) and used for layout.

				</name>
				<description>
					Determines in which direction the next view lays. Consider the View at index n. Typically the Views are layed out from left to right, so that the View to the EAST will be at index n + 1, and the View to the WEST will be at index n - 1. In certain situations, such as with bidirectional text, it is possible that the View to EAST is not at index n + 1, but rather at index n - 1, or that the View to the WEST is not at index n - 1, but index n + 1. In this case this method would return true, indicating the Views are layed out in descending order. This will return true if the text is layed out right to left at position, otherwise false.

					public맍loat맕extTabStop(float맞,                  int맚abOffset)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the next tab stop position given a reference position. This view implements the tab coordinate system, and calls getTabbedSpan on the logical children in the process of layout to determine the desired span of the children. The logical children can delegate their tab expansion upward to the paragraph which knows how to expand tabs. LabelView is an example of a view that delegates its tab expansion needs upward to the paragraph. This is implemented to try and locate a TabSet in the paragraph element's attribute set. If one can be found, its settings will be used, otherwise a default expansion will be provided. The base location for for tab expansion is the left inset from the paragraphs most recent allocation (which is what the layout of the children is based upon).

					public말nt많etBreakWeight(int마xis,                   float맓en)
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the break weight for a given location. ParagraphView instances are breakable along the Y_AXIS only, and only if len is after the first row. If the length is less than one row, a value of BadBreakWeight is returned.

				</name>
				<description>
					Calculate the needs for the paragraph along the minor axis. This uses size requirements of the superclass, modified to take into account the non-breakable areas at the adjacent views edges. The minimal size requirements for such views should be no less than the sum of all adjacent fragments. If the axis parameter is neither View.X_AXIS nor View.Y_AXIS, IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If the r parameter is null, a new SizeRequirements object is created, otherwise the supplied SizeRequirements object is returned.
