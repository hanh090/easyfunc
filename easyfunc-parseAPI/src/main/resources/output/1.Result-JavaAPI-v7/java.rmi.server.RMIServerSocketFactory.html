		<description>
			An RMIServerSocketFactory instance is used by the RMI runtime in order to obtain server sockets for RMI calls. A remote object can be associated with an RMIServerSocketFactory when it is created/exported via the constructors or exportObject methods of java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject and java.rmi.activation.Activatable . An RMIServerSocketFactory instance associated with a remote object is used to obtain the ServerSocket used to accept incoming calls from clients. An RMIServerSocketFactory instance can also be associated with a remote object registry so that clients can use custom socket communication with a remote object registry. An implementation of this interface should implement Object.equals(java.lang.Object) to return true when passed an instance that represents the same (functionally equivalent) server socket factory, and false otherwise (and it should also implement Object.hashCode() consistently with its Object.equals implementation).
