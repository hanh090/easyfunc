			public static class DataLine.Info  extends Line.Info
		</name>
		<description>
			Besides the class information inherited from its superclass, DataLine.Info provides additional information specific to data lines. This information includes: the audio formats supported by the data line the minimum and maximum sizes of its internal buffer Because a Line.Info knows the class of the line its describes, a DataLine.Info object can describe DataLine subinterfaces such as SourceDataLine, TargetDataLine, and Clip. You can query a mixer for lines of any of these types, passing an appropriate instance of DataLine.Info as the argument to a method such as Mixer.getLine(Line.Info).

				<description>
					Constructs a data line's info object from the specified information, which includes a set of supported audio formats and a range for the buffer size. This constructor is typically used by mixer implementations when returning information about a supported line.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a data line's info object from the specified information, which includes a single audio format and a desired buffer size. This constructor is typically used by an application to describe a desired line.

					publicㅁudioFormat[]많etFormats()
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains a set of audio formats supported by the data line. Note that isFormatSupported(AudioFormat) might return true for certain additional formats that are missing from the set returned by getFormats(). The reverse is not the case: isFormatSupported(AudioFormat) is guaranteed to return true for all formats returned by getFormats(). Some fields in the AudioFormat instances can be set to NOT_SPECIFIED if that field does not apply to the format, or if the format supports a wide range of values for that field. For example, a multi-channel device supporting up to 64 channels, could set the channel field in the AudioFormat instances returned by this method to NOT_SPECIFIED.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sFormatSupported(AudioFormat맍ormat)
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates whether this data line supports a particular audio format. The default implementation of this method simply returns true if the specified format matches any of the supported formats.

				<description>
					Obtains the minimum buffer size supported by the data line.

			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etMaxBufferSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains the maximum buffer size supported by the data line.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean맔atches(Line.Info말nfo)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether the specified info object matches this one. To match, the superclass match requirements must be met. In addition, this object's minimum buffer size must be at least as large as that of the object specified, its maximum buffer size must be at most as large as that of the object specified, and all of its formats must match formats supported by the object specified.

					Obtains a textual description of the data line info.
