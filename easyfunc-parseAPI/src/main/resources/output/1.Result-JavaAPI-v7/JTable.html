			The JTable is used to display and edit regular two-dimensional tables of cells. See How to Use Tables in The Java Tutorial for task-oriented documentation and examples of using JTable. The JTable has many facilities that make it possible to customize its rendering and editing but provides defaults for these features so that simple tables can be set up easily. For example, to set up a table with 10 rows and 10 columns of numbers:         TableModel dataModel = new AbstractTableModel() {            public int getColumnCount() { return 10; }            public int getRowCount() { return 10;}            public Object getValueAt(int row, int col) { return new Integer(row*col); }        };        JTable table = new JTable(dataModel);        JScrollPane scrollpane = new JScrollPane(table);   JTables are typically placed inside of a JScrollPane. By default, a JTable will adjust its width such that a horizontal scrollbar is unnecessary. To allow for a horizontal scrollbar, invoke setAutoResizeMode(int) with AUTO_RESIZE_OFF. Note that if you wish to use a JTable in a standalone view (outside of a JScrollPane) and want the header displayed, you can get it using getTableHeader() and display it separately. To enable sorting and filtering of rows, use a RowSorter. You can set up a row sorter in either of two ways: Directly set the RowSorter. For example: table.setRowSorter(new TableRowSorter(model)). Set the autoCreateRowSorter property to true, so that the JTable creates a RowSorter for you. For example: setAutoCreateRowSorter(true). When designing applications that use the JTable it is worth paying close attention to the data structures that will represent the table's data. The DefaultTableModel is a model implementation that uses a Vector of Vectors of Objects to store the cell values. As well as copying the data from an application into the DefaultTableModel, it is also possible to wrap the data in the methods of the TableModel interface so that the data can be passed to the JTable directly, as in the example above. This often results in more efficient applications because the model is free to choose the internal representation that best suits the data. A good rule of thumb for deciding whether to use the AbstractTableModel or the DefaultTableModel is to use the AbstractTableModel as the base class for creating subclasses and the DefaultTableModel when subclassing is not required. The "TableExample" directory in the demo area of the source distribution gives a number of complete examples of JTable usage, covering how the JTable can be used to provide an editable view of data taken from a database and how to modify the columns in the display to use specialized renderers and editors. The JTable uses integers exclusively to refer to both the rows and the columns of the model that it displays. The JTable simply takes a tabular range of cells and uses getValueAt(int, int) to retrieve the values from the model during painting. It is important to remember that the column and row indexes returned by various JTable methods are in terms of the JTable (the view) and are not necessarily the same indexes used by the model. By default, columns may be rearranged in the JTable so that the view's columns appear in a different order to the columns in the model. This does not affect the implementation of the model at all: when the columns are reordered, the JTable maintains the new order of the columns internally and converts its column indices before querying the model. So, when writing a TableModel, it is not necessary to listen for column reordering events as the model will be queried in its own coordinate system regardless of what is happening in the view. In the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system where the order of the rows is changed, rather than the order of the columns. Similarly when using the sorting and filtering functionality provided by RowSorter the underlying TableModel does not need to know how to do sorting, rather RowSorter will handle it. Coordinate conversions will be necessary when using the row based methods of JTable with the underlying TableModel. All of JTables row based methods are in terms of the RowSorter, which is not necessarily the same as that of the underlying TableModel. For example, the selection is always in terms of JTable so that when using RowSorter you will need to convert using convertRowIndexToView or convertRowIndexToModel. The following shows how to convert coordinates from JTable to that of the underlying model:      int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows();     for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {       selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]);     }     // selection is now in terms of the underlying TableModel   By default if sorting is enabled JTable will persist the selection and variable row heights in terms of the model on sorting. For example if row 0, in terms of the underlying model, is currently selected, after the sort row 0, in terms of the underlying model will be selected. Visually the selection may change, but in terms of the underlying model it will remain the same. The one exception to that is if the model index is no longer visible or was removed. For example, if row 0 in terms of model was filtered out the selection will be empty after the sort. J2SE 5 adds methods to JTable to provide convenient access to some common printing needs. Simple new print() methods allow for quick and easy addition of printing support to your application. In addition, a new getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat) method is available for more advanced printing needs. As for all JComponent classes, you can use InputMap and ActionMap to associate an Action object with a KeyStroke and execute the action under specified conditions. Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more information see Swing's Threading Policy. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets a default cell editor to be used if no editor has been set in a TableColumn. If no editing is required in a table, or a particular column in a table, uses the isCellEditable method in the TableModel interface to ensure that this JTable will not start an editor in these columns. If editor is null, removes the default editor for this column class.

The JTable installs entries for Object, Number, and Boolean, all of which can be modified or replaced.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setDragEnabled(boolean b)
				</name>
				<description>
					Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic drag handling, this property should be set to true, and the table's TransferHandler needs to be non-null. The default value of the dragEnabled property is false. The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture, lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the table's TableUI. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and feels (including those that subclass BasicLookAndFeel) begin a drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over an item (in single selection mode) or a selection (in other selection modes) and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to true can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave. If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still begin a drag and drop operation by calling exportAsDrag on the table's TransferHandler.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getDragEnabled()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final void setDropMode(DropMode dropMode)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility, the default for this property is DropMode.USE_SELECTION. Usage of one of the other modes is recommended, however, for an improved user experience. DropMode.ON, for instance, offers similar behavior of showing items as selected, but does so without affecting the actual selection in the table. JTable supports the following drop modes: DropMode.USE_SELECTION DropMode.ON DropMode.INSERT DropMode.INSERT_ROWS DropMode.INSERT_COLS DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_ROWS DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_COLS The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a TransferHandler that accepts drops.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final DropMode getDropMode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the drop mode for this component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final JTable.DropLocation getDropLocation()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the location that this component should visually indicate as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component, or null if no location is to currently be shown. This method is not meant for querying the drop location from a TransferHandler, as the drop location is only set after the TransferHandler's canImport has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown. When this property changes, a property change event with name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setAutoCreateRowSorter(boolean autoCreateRowSorter)
				</name>
				<description>
					Specifies whether a RowSorter should be created for the table whenever its model changes. When setAutoCreateRowSorter(true) is invoked, a TableRowSorter is immediately created and installed on the table. While the autoCreateRowSorter property remains true, every time the model is changed, a new TableRowSorter is created and set as the table's row sorter.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getAutoCreateRowSorter()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if whenever the model changes, a new RowSorter should be created and installed as the table's sorter; otherwise, returns false.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setUpdateSelectionOnSort(boolean update)
				</name>
				<description>
					Specifies whether the selection should be updated after sorting. If true, on sorting the selection is reset such that the same rows, in terms of the model, remain selected. The default is true.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getUpdateSelectionOnSort()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the selection should be updated after sorting.

					public void setRowSorter(RowSorter<? extends TableModel> sorter)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the RowSorter. RowSorter is used to provide sorting and filtering to a JTable. This method clears the selection and resets any variable row heights. This method fires a PropertyChangeEvent when appropriate, with the property name "rowSorter". For backward-compatibility, this method fires an additional event with the property name "sorter". If the underlying model of the RowSorter differs from that of this JTable undefined behavior will result.

					public void setSelectionMode(int selectionMode)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the table's selection mode to allow only single selections, a single contiguous interval, or multiple intervals. Note: JTable provides all the methods for handling column and row selection. When setting states, such as setSelectionMode, it not only updates the mode for the row selection model but also sets similar values in the selection model of the columnModel. If you want to have the row and column selection models operating in different modes, set them both directly. Both the row and column selection models for JTable default to using a DefaultListSelectionModel so that JTable works the same way as the JList. See the setSelectionMode method in JList for details about the modes.

				</name>
				<description>
					Updates the selection models of the table, depending on the state of the two flags: toggle and extend. Most changes to the selection that are the result of keyboard or mouse events received by the UI are channeled through this method so that the behavior may be overridden by a subclass. Some UIs may need more functionality than this method provides, such as when manipulating the lead for discontiguous selection, and may not call into this method for some selection changes. This implementation uses the following conventions: toggle: false, extend: false. Clear the previous selection and ensure the new cell is selected. toggle: false, extend: true. Extend the previous selection from the anchor to the specified cell, clearing all other selections. toggle: true, extend: false. If the specified cell is selected, deselect it. If it is not selected, select it. toggle: true, extend: true. Apply the selection state of the anchor to all cells between it and the specified cell.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a rectangle for the cell that lies at the intersection of row and column. If includeSpacing is true then the value returned has the full height and width of the row and column specified. If it is false, the returned rectangle is inset by the intercell spacing to return the true bounds of the rendering or editing component as it will be set during rendering. If the column index is valid but the row index is less than zero the method returns a rectangle with the y and height values set appropriately and the x and width values both set to zero. In general, when either the row or column indices indicate a cell outside the appropriate range, the method returns a rectangle depicting the closest edge of the closest cell that is within the table's range. When both row and column indices are out of range the returned rectangle covers the closest point of the closest cell. In all cases, calculations that use this method to calculate results along one axis will not fail because of anomalies in calculations along the other axis. When the cell is not valid the includeSpacing parameter is ignored.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void doLayout()
				</name>
				<description>
					Causes this table to lay out its rows and columns. Overridden so that columns can be resized to accomodate a change in the size of a containing parent. Resizes one or more of the columns in the table so that the total width of all of this JTable's columns is equal to the width of the table. Before the layout begins the method gets the resizingColumn of the tableHeader. When the method is called as a result of the resizing of an enclosing window, the resizingColumn is null. This means that resizing has taken place "outside" the JTable and the change - or "delta" - should be distributed to all of the columns regardless of this JTable's automatic resize mode. If the resizingColumn is not null, it is one of the columns in the table that has changed size rather than the table itself. In this case the auto-resize modes govern the way the extra (or deficit) space is distributed amongst the available columns. The modes are: AUTO_RESIZE_OFF: Don't automatically adjust the column's widths at all. Use a horizontal scrollbar to accomodate the columns when their sum exceeds the width of the Viewport. If the JTable is not enclosed in a JScrollPane this may leave parts of the table invisible. AUTO_RESIZE_NEXT_COLUMN: Use just the column after the resizing column. This results in the "boundary" or divider between adjacent cells being independently adjustable. AUTO_RESIZE_SUBSEQUENT_COLUMNS: Use all columns after the one being adjusted to absorb the changes. This is the default behavior. AUTO_RESIZE_LAST_COLUMN: Automatically adjust the size of the last column only. If the bounds of the last column prevent the desired size from being allocated, set the width of the last column to the appropriate limit and make no further adjustments. AUTO_RESIZE_ALL_COLUMNS: Spread the delta amongst all the columns in the JTable, including the one that is being adjusted. Note: When a JTable makes adjustments to the widths of the columns it respects their minimum and maximum values absolutely. It is therefore possible that, even after this method is called, the total width of the columns is still not equal to the width of the table. When this happens the JTable does not put itself in AUTO_RESIZE_OFF mode to bring up a scroll bar, or break other commitments of its current auto-resize mode -- instead it allows its bounds to be set larger (or smaller) than the total of the column minimum or maximum, meaning, either that there will not be enough room to display all of the columns, or that the columns will not fill the JTable's bounds. These respectively, result in the clipping of some columns or an area being painted in the JTable's background color during painting. The mechanism for distributing the delta amongst the available columns is provided in a private method in the JTable class:      adjustSizes(long targetSize, final Resizable3 r, boolean inverse)   an explanation of which is provided in the following section. Resizable3 is a private interface that allows any data structure containing a collection of elements with a size, preferred size, maximum size and minimum size to have its elements manipulated by the algorithm. Distributing the delta Overview Call "DELTA" the difference between the target size and the sum of the preferred sizes of the elements in r. The individual sizes are calculated by taking the original preferred sizes and adding a share of the DELTA - that share being based on how far each preferred size is from its limiting bound (minimum or maximum). Definition Call the individual constraints min[i], max[i], and pref[i]. Call their respective sums: MIN, MAX, and PREF. Each new size will be calculated using:             size[i] = pref[i] + delta[i]   where each individual delta[i] is calculated according to: If (DELTA < 0) we are in shrink mode where:                           DELTA            delta[i] = ------------ * (pref[i] - min[i])                       (PREF - MIN)   If (DELTA > 0) we are in expand mode where:                           DELTA            delta[i] = ------------ * (max[i] - pref[i])                        (MAX - PREF)   The overall effect is that the total size moves that same percentage, k, towards the total minimum or maximum and that percentage guarantees accomodation of the required space, DELTA. Details Naive evaluation of the formulae presented here would be subject to the aggregated rounding errors caused by doing this operation in finite precision (using ints). To deal with this, the multiplying factor above, is constantly recalculated and this takes account of the rounding errors in the previous iterations. The result is an algorithm that produces a set of integers whose values exactly sum to the supplied targetSize, and does so by spreading the rounding errors evenly over the given elements. When the MAX and MIN bounds are hit When targetSize is outside the [MIN, MAX] range, the algorithm sets all sizes to their appropriate limiting value (maximum or minimum).

				<description>
					Prints this JTable. Takes steps that the majority of developers would take in order to print a JTable. In short, it prepares the table, calls getPrintable to fetch an appropriate Printable, and then sends it to the printer. A boolean parameter allows you to specify whether or not a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes, or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a PrintService and printing attributes to be specified. These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the print dialog, or to specify values when the dialog is not shown. A second boolean parameter allows you to specify whether or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If true, a modal progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which may affect the table. However, it can not prevent the table from being modified by code (for example, another thread that posts updates using SwingUtilities.invokeLater). It is therefore the responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include changes in: size, renderers, or underlying data). Printing behavior is undefined when the table is changed during printing. If false is specified for this parameter, no dialog will be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event-dispatch thread. This blocks any other events, including repaints, from being processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents the table from being changed, it doesn't provide a good user experience. For this reason, specifying false is only recommended when printing from an application with no visible GUI. Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively, while in headless mode, will result in a HeadlessException. Before fetching the printable, this method will gracefully terminate editing, if necessary, to prevent an editor from showing in the printed result. Additionally, JTable will prepare its renderers during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated. As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout, developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize on the value of JComponent.isPaintingForPrint(). See getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat) for more description on how the table is printed.

					Return a Printable for use in printing this JTable. This method is meant for those wishing to customize the default Printable implementation used by JTable's print methods. Developers wanting simply to print the table should use one of those methods directly. The Printable can be requested in one of two printing modes. In both modes, it spreads table rows naturally in sequence across multiple pages, fitting as many rows as possible per page. PrintMode.NORMAL specifies that the table be printed at its current size. In this mode, there may be a need to spread columns across pages in a similar manner to that of the rows. When the need arises, columns are distributed in an order consistent with the table's ComponentOrientation. PrintMode.FIT_WIDTH specifies that the output be scaled smaller, if necessary, to fit the table's entire width (and thereby all columns) on each page. Width and height are scaled equally, maintaining the aspect ratio of the output. The Printable heads the portion of table on each page with the appropriate section from the table's JTableHeader, if it has one. Header and footer text can be added to the output by providing MessageFormat arguments. The printing code requests Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be included in the formatted string: an Integer representing the current page number. You are encouraged to read the documentation for MessageFormat as some characters, such as single-quote, are special and need to be escaped. Here's an example of creating a MessageFormat that can be used to print "Duke's Table: Page - " and the current page number:        // notice the escaping of the single quote       // notice how the page number is included with "{0}"       MessageFormat format = new MessageFormat("Duke''s Table: Page - {0}");   The Printable constrains what it draws to the printable area of each page that it prints. Under certain circumstances, it may find it impossible to fit all of a page's content into that area. In these cases the output may be clipped, but the implementation makes an effort to do something reasonable. Here are a few situations where this is known to occur, and how they may be handled by this particular implementation: In any mode, when the header or footer text is too wide to fit completely in the printable area -- print as much of the text as possible starting from the beginning, as determined by the table's ComponentOrientation. In any mode, when a row is too tall to fit in the printable area -- print the upper-most portion of the row and paint no lower border on the table. In PrintMode.NORMAL when a column is too wide to fit in the printable area -- print the center portion of the column and leave the left and right borders off the table. It is entirely valid for this Printable to be wrapped inside another in order to create complex reports and documents. You may even request that different pages be rendered into different sized printable areas. The implementation must be prepared to handle this (possibly by doing its layout calculations on the fly). However, providing different heights to each page will likely not work well with PrintMode.NORMAL when it has to spread columns across pages. As far as customizing how the table looks in the printed result, JTable itself will take care of hiding the selection and focus during printing. For additional customizations, your renderers or painting code can customize the look based on the value of JComponent.isPaintingForPrint() Also, before calling this method you may wish to first modify the state of the table, such as to cancel cell editing or have the user size the table appropriately. However, you must not modify the state of the table after this Printable has been fetched (invalid modifications include changes in size or underlying data). The behavior of the returned Printable is undefined once the table has been changed.
