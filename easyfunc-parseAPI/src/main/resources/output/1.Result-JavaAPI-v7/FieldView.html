			public class FieldView  extends PlainView
		</name>
		<description>
			Extends the multi-line plain text view to be suitable for a single-line editor view. If the view is allocated extra space, the field must adjust for it. If the hosting component is a JTextField, this view will manage the ranges of the associated BoundedRangeModel and will adjust the horizontal allocation to match the current visibility settings of the JTextField.
