			public class DragSourceDragEvent  extends DragSourceEvent
		</name>
		<description>
			The DragSourceDragEvent is delivered from the DragSourceContextPeer, via the DragSourceContext, to the DragSourceListener registered with that DragSourceContext and with its associated DragSource. The DragSourceDragEvent reports the target drop action and the user drop action that reflect the current state of the drag operation. Target drop action is one of DnDConstants that represents the drop action selected by the current drop target if this drop action is supported by the drag source or DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE if this drop action is not supported by the drag source. User drop action depends on the drop actions supported by the drag source and the drop action selected by the user. The user can select a drop action by pressing modifier keys during the drag operation:      Ctrl + Shift -> ACTION_LINK     Ctrl         -> ACTION_COPY     Shift        -> ACTION_MOVE   If the user selects a drop action, the user drop action is one of DnDConstants that represents the selected drop action if this drop action is supported by the drag source or DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE if this drop action is not supported by the drag source. If the user doesn't select a drop action, the set of DnDConstants that represents the set of drop actions supported by the drag source is searched for DnDConstants.ACTION_MOVE, then for DnDConstants.ACTION_COPY, then for DnDConstants.ACTION_LINK and the user drop action is the first constant found. If no constant is found the user drop action is DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE.

				<description>
					Constructs a DragSourceDragEvent. This class is typically instantiated by the DragSourceContextPeer rather than directly by client code. The coordinates for this DragSourceDragEvent are not specified, so getLocation will return null for this event. The arguments dropAction and action should be one of DnDConstants that represents a single action. The argument modifiers should be either a bitwise mask of old java.awt.event.InputEvent.*_MASK constants or a bitwise mask of extended java.awt.event.InputEvent.*_DOWN_MASK constants. This constructor does not throw any exception for invalid dropAction, action and modifiers.

					Constructs a DragSourceDragEvent given the specified DragSourceContext, user drop action, target drop action, modifiers and coordinates. The arguments dropAction and action should be one of DnDConstants that represents a single action. The argument modifiers should be either a bitwise mask of old java.awt.event.InputEvent.*_MASK constants or a bitwise mask of extended java.awt.event.InputEvent.*_DOWN_MASK constants. This constructor does not throw any exception for invalid dropAction, action and modifiers.

					public말nt많etGestureModifiers()
				</name>
				<description>
					This method returns an int representing the current state of the input device modifiers associated with the user's gesture. Typically these would be mouse buttons or keyboard modifiers. If the modifiers passed to the constructor are invalid, this method returns them unchanged.

				<description>
					This method returns an int representing the current state of the input device extended modifiers associated with the user's gesture. See InputEvent.getModifiersEx() If the modifiers passed to the constructor are invalid, this method returns them unchanged.
