			Instructs JAXB to also bind other classes when binding this class. Java makes it impractical/impossible to list all sub-classes of a given class. This often gets in a way of JAXB users, as it JAXB cannot automatically list up the classes that need to be known to JAXBContext. For example, with the following class definitions:    class Animal {}   class Dog extends Animal {}   class Cat extends Animal {}   The user would be required to create JAXBContext as JAXBContext.newInstance(Dog.class,Cat.class) (Animal will be automatically picked up since Dog and Cat refers to it.) XmlSeeAlso annotation would allow you to write:    @XmlSeeAlso({Dog.class,Cat.class})   class Animal {}   class Dog extends Animal {}   class Cat extends Animal {}   This would allow you to do JAXBContext.newInstance(Animal.class). By the help of this annotation, JAXB implementations will be able to correctly bind Dog and Cat.
