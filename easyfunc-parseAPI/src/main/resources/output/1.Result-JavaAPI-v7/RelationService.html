		</name>
		<description>
			The Relation Service is in charge of creating and deleting relation types and relations, of handling the consistency and of providing query mechanisms. It implements the NotificationBroadcaster by extending NotificationBroadcasterSupport to send notifications when a relation is removed from it. It implements the NotificationListener interface to be able to receive notifications concerning unregistration of MBeans referenced in relation roles and of relation MBeans. It implements the MBeanRegistration interface to be able to retrieve its ObjectName and MBean Server.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: MBeanRegistration Allows the MBean to perform any operations it needs before being registered in the MBean Server. If the name of the MBean is not specified, the MBean can provide a name for its registration. If any exception is raised, the MBean will not be registered in the MBean Server.

					public void postRegister(Boolean registrationDone)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: MBeanRegistration Allows the MBean to perform any operations needed after having been registered in the MBean server or after the registration has failed. If the implementation of this method throws a RuntimeException or an Error, the MBean Server will rethrow those inside a RuntimeMBeanException or RuntimeErrorException, respectively. However, throwing an exception in postRegister will not change the state of the MBean: if the MBean was already registered (registrationDone is true), the MBean will remain registered. This might be confusing for the code calling createMBean() or registerMBean(), as such code might assume that MBean registration has failed when such an exception is raised. Therefore it is recommended that implementations of postRegister do not throw Runtime Exceptions or Errors if it can be avoided.

					Description copied from interface: MBeanRegistration Allows the MBean to perform any operations needed after having been unregistered in the MBean server. If the implementation of this method throws a RuntimeException or an Error, the MBean Server will rethrow those inside a RuntimeMBeanException or RuntimeErrorException, respectively. However, throwing an exception in postDeregister will not change the state of the MBean: the MBean was already successfully deregistered and will remain so. This might be confusing for the code calling unregisterMBean(), as it might assume that MBean deregistration has failed. Therefore it is recommended that implementations of postDeregister do not throw Runtime Exceptions or Errors if it can be avoided.

					public void purgeRelations()                      throws RelationServiceNotRegisteredException

				<description>
					Purges the relations. Depending on the purgeFlag value, this method is either called automatically when a notification is received for the unregistration of an MBean referenced in a relation (if the flag is set to true), or not (if the flag is set to false). In that case it is up to the user to call it to maintain the consistency of the relations. To be kept in mind that if an MBean is unregistered and the purge not done immediately, if the ObjectName is reused and assigned to another MBean referenced in a relation, calling manually this purgeRelations() method will cause trouble, as will consider the ObjectName as corresponding to the unregistered MBean, not seeing the new one. The behavior depends on the cardinality of the role where the unregistered MBean is referenced: - if removing one MBean reference in the role makes its number of references less than the minimum degree, the relation has to be removed. - if the remaining number of references after removing the MBean reference is still in the cardinality range, keep the relation and update it calling its handleMBeanUnregistration() callback.
