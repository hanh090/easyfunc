			public class StyledEditorKit  extends DefaultEditorKit
		</name>
		<description>
			This is the set of things needed by a text component to be a reasonably functioning editor for some type of text document. This implementation provides a default implementation which treats text as styled text and provides a minimal set of actions for editing styled text.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicViewFactory많etViewFactory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches a factory that is suitable for producing views of any models that are produced by this kit. This is implemented to return View implementations for the following kinds of elements: AbstractDocument.ContentElementName AbstractDocument.ParagraphElementName AbstractDocument.SectionElementName StyleConstants.ComponentElementName StyleConstants.IconElementName

					Copies the key/values in elements AttributeSet into set. This does not copy component, icon, or element names attributes. Subclasses may wish to refine what is and what isn't copied here. But be sure to first remove all the attributes that are in set. This is called anytime the caret moves over a different location.
