		<description>
			A component is an object having a graphical representation that can be displayed on the screen and that can interact with the user. Examples of components are the buttons, checkboxes, and scrollbars of a typical graphical user interface. The Component class is the abstract superclass of the nonmenu-related Abstract Window Toolkit components. Class Component can also be extended directly to create a lightweight component. A lightweight component is a component that is not associated with a native window. On the contrary, a heavyweight component is associated with a native window. The isLightweight() method may be used to distinguish between the two kinds of the components. Lightweight and heavyweight components may be mixed in a single component hierarchy. However, for correct operating of such a mixed hierarchy of components, the whole hierarchy must be valid. When the hierarchy gets invalidated, like after changing the bounds of components, or adding/removing components to/from containers, the whole hierarchy must be validated afterwards by means of the Container.validate() method invoked on the top-most invalid container of the hierarchy. Serialization It is important to note that only AWT listeners which conform to the Serializable protocol will be saved when the object is stored. If an AWT object has listeners that aren't marked serializable, they will be dropped at writeObject time. Developers will need, as always, to consider the implications of making an object serializable. One situation to watch out for is this:       import java.awt.*;      import java.awt.event.*;      import java.io.Serializable;        class MyApp implements ActionListener, Serializable      {          BigObjectThatShouldNotBeSerializedWithAButton bigOne;          Button aButton = new Button();            MyApp()          {              // Oops, now aButton has a listener with a reference              // to bigOne!              aButton.addActionListener(this);          }            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)          {              System.out.println("Hello There");          }      }   In this example, serializing aButton by itself will cause MyApp and everything it refers to to be serialized as well. The problem is that the listener is serializable by coincidence, not by design. To separate the decisions about MyApp and the ActionListener being serializable one can use a nested class, as in the following example:       import java.awt.*;      import java.awt.event.*;      import java.io.Serializable;        class MyApp java.io.Serializable      {           BigObjectThatShouldNotBeSerializedWithAButton bigOne;           Button aButton = new Button();             static class MyActionListener implements ActionListener           {               public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)               {                   System.out.println("Hello There");               }           }             MyApp()           {               aButton.addActionListener(new MyActionListener());           }      }   Note: For more information on the paint mechanisms utilitized by AWT and Swing, including information on how to write the most efficient painting code, see Painting in AWT and Swing.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isValid()
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether this component is valid. A component is valid when it is correctly sized and positioned within its parent container and all its children are also valid. In order to account for peers' size requirements, components are invalidated before they are first shown on the screen. By the time the parent container is fully realized, all its components will be valid.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isDisplayable()
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether this component is displayable. A component is displayable when it is connected to a native screen resource. A component is made displayable either when it is added to a displayable containment hierarchy or when its containment hierarchy is made displayable. A containment hierarchy is made displayable when its ancestor window is either packed or made visible. A component is made undisplayable either when it is removed from a displayable containment hierarchy or when its containment hierarchy is made undisplayable. A containment hierarchy is made undisplayable when its ancestor window is disposed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isVisible()
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether this component should be visible when its parent is visible. Components are initially visible, with the exception of top level components such as Frame objects.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Point getMousePosition()                         throws HeadlessException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the position of the mouse pointer in this Component's coordinate space if the Component is directly under the mouse pointer, otherwise returns null. If the Component is not showing on the screen, this method returns null even if the mouse pointer is above the area where the Component would be displayed. If the Component is partially or fully obscured by other Components or native windows, this method returns a non-null value only if the mouse pointer is located above the unobscured part of the Component. For Containers it returns a non-null value if the mouse is above the Container itself or above any of its descendants. Use Container.getMousePosition(boolean) if you need to exclude children. Sometimes the exact mouse coordinates are not important, and the only thing that matters is whether a specific Component is under the mouse pointer. If the return value of this method is null, mouse pointer is not directly above the Component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isShowing()
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether this component is showing on screen. This means that the component must be visible, and it must be in a container that is visible and showing. Note: sometimes there is no way to detect whether the Component is actually visible to the user. This can happen when: the component has been added to a visible ScrollPane but the Component is not currently in the scroll pane's view port. the Component is obscured by another Component or Container.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isEnabled()
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether this component is enabled. An enabled component can respond to user input and generate events. Components are enabled initially by default. A component may be enabled or disabled by calling its setEnabled method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setEnabled(boolean b)
				</name>
				<description>
					Enables or disables this component, depending on the value of the parameter b. An enabled component can respond to user input and generate events. Components are enabled initially by default. Note: Disabling a lightweight component does not prevent it from receiving MouseEvents. Note: Disabling a heavyweight container prevents all components in this container from receiving any input events. But disabling a lightweight container affects only this container.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Point getLocation()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the location of this component in the form of a point specifying the component's top-left corner. The location will be relative to the parent's coordinate space. Due to the asynchronous nature of native event handling, this method can return outdated values (for instance, after several calls of setLocation() in rapid succession). For this reason, the recommended method of obtaining a component's position is within java.awt.event.ComponentListener.componentMoved(), which is called after the operating system has finished moving the component.

				<description>
					Returns true if this component is completely opaque, returns false by default. An opaque component paints every pixel within its rectangular region. A non-opaque component paints only some of its pixels, allowing the pixels underneath it to "show through". A component that does not fully paint its pixels therefore provides a degree of transparency. Subclasses that guarantee to always completely paint their contents should override this method and return true.

					public boolean isLightweight()
				</name>
				<description>
					A lightweight component doesn't have a native toolkit peer. Subclasses of Component and Container, other than the ones defined in this package like Button or Scrollbar, are lightweight. All of the Swing components are lightweights. This method will always return false if this component is not displayable because it is impossible to determine the weight of an undisplayable component.

			<method>
				<name>
					public float getAlignmentX()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the alignment along the x axis. This specifies how the component would like to be aligned relative to other components. The value should be a number between 0 and 1 where 0 represents alignment along the origin, 1 is aligned the furthest away from the origin, 0.5 is centered, etc.

			<method>
				<name>
					public int getBaseline(int width,                int height)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the baseline. The baseline is measured from the top of the component. This method is primarily meant for LayoutManagers to align components along their baseline. A return value less than 0 indicates this component does not have a reasonable baseline and that LayoutManagers should not align this component on its baseline. The default implementation returns -1. Subclasses that support baseline should override appropriately. If a value >= 0 is returned, then the component has a valid baseline for any size >= the minimum size and getBaselineResizeBehavior can be used to determine how the baseline changes with size.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Component.BaselineResizeBehavior getBaselineResizeBehavior()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an enum indicating how the baseline of the component changes as the size changes. This method is primarily meant for layout managers and GUI builders. The default implementation returns BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER. Subclasses that have a baseline should override appropriately. Subclasses should never return null; if the baseline can not be calculated return BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER. Callers should first ask for the baseline using getBaseline and if a value >= 0 is returned use this method. It is acceptable for this method to return a value other than BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER even if getBaseline returns a value less than 0.

					Validates this component. The meaning of the term validating is defined by the ancestors of this class. See Container.validate() for more details.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void invalidate()
				</name>
				<description>
					Invalidates this component and its ancestors. By default, all the ancestors of the component up to the top-most container of the hierarchy are marked invalid. If the java.awt.smartInvalidate system property is set to true, invalidation stops on the nearest validate root of this component. Marking a container invalid indicates that the container needs to be laid out. This method is called automatically when any layout-related information changes (e.g. setting the bounds of the component, or adding the component to a container). This method might be called often, so it should work fast.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void revalidate()
				</name>
				<description>
					Revalidates the component hierarchy up to the nearest validate root. This method first invalidates the component hierarchy starting from this component up to the nearest validate root. Afterwards, the component hierarchy is validated starting from the nearest validate root. This is a convenience method supposed to help application developers avoid looking for validate roots manually. Basically, it's equivalent to first calling the invalidate() method on this component, and then calling the validate() method on the nearest validate root.

					public FontMetrics getFontMetrics(Font font)
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the font metrics for the specified font. Warning: Since Font metrics are affected by the FontRenderContext and this method does not provide one, it can return only metrics for the default render context which may not match that used when rendering on the Component if Graphics2D functionality is being used. Instead metrics can be obtained at rendering time by calling Graphics.getFontMetrics() or text measurement APIs on the Font class.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the cursor image to the specified cursor. This cursor image is displayed when the contains method for this component returns true for the current cursor location, and this Component is visible, displayable, and enabled. Setting the cursor of a Container causes that cursor to be displayed within all of the container's subcomponents, except for those that have a non-null cursor. The method may have no visual effect if the Java platform implementation and/or the native system do not support changing the mouse cursor shape.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Cursor getCursor()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the cursor set in the component. If the component does not have a cursor set, the cursor of its parent is returned. If no cursor is set in the entire hierarchy, Cursor.DEFAULT_CURSOR is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isCursorSet()

					public void paint(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Paints this component. This method is called when the contents of the component should be painted; such as when the component is first being shown or is damaged and in need of repair. The clip rectangle in the Graphics parameter is set to the area which needs to be painted. Subclasses of Component that override this method need not call super.paint(g). For performance reasons, Components with zero width or height aren't considered to need painting when they are first shown, and also aren't considered to need repair. Note: For more information on the paint mechanisms utilitized by AWT and Swing, including information on how to write the most efficient painting code, see Painting in AWT and Swing.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void update(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Updates this component. If this component is not a lightweight component, the AWT calls the update method in response to a call to repaint. You can assume that the background is not cleared. The update method of Component calls this component's paint method to redraw this component. This method is commonly overridden by subclasses which need to do additional work in response to a call to repaint. Subclasses of Component that override this method should either call super.update(g), or call paint(g) directly from their update method. The origin of the graphics context, its (0, 0) coordinate point, is the top-left corner of this component. The clipping region of the graphics context is the bounding rectangle of this component. Note: For more information on the paint mechanisms utilitized by AWT and Swing, including information on how to write the most efficient painting code, see Painting in AWT and Swing.

				</name>
				<description>
					Repaints the component when the image has changed. This imageUpdate method of an ImageObserver is called when more information about an image which had been previously requested using an asynchronous routine such as the drawImage method of Graphics becomes available. See the definition of imageUpdate for more information on this method and its arguments. The imageUpdate method of Component incrementally draws an image on the component as more of the bits of the image are available. If the system property awt.image.incrementaldraw is missing or has the value true, the image is incrementally drawn. If the system property has any other value, then the image is not drawn until it has been completely loaded. Also, if incremental drawing is in effect, the value of the system property awt.image.redrawrate is interpreted as an integer to give the maximum redraw rate, in milliseconds. If the system property is missing or cannot be interpreted as an integer, the redraw rate is once every 100ms. The interpretation of the x, y, width, and height arguments depends on the value of the infoflags argument.

				<description>
					Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as FooListeners upon this Component. FooListeners are registered using the addFooListener method. You can specify the listenerType argument with a class literal, such as FooListener.class. For example, you can query a Component c for its mouse listeners with the following code: MouseListener[] mls = (MouseListener[])(c.getListeners(MouseListener.class)); If no such listeners exist, this method returns an empty array.

					protected AWTEvent coalesceEvents(AWTEvent existingEvent,                        AWTEvent newEvent)
				</name>
				<description>
					Potentially coalesce an event being posted with an existing event. This method is called by EventQueue.postEvent if an event with the same ID as the event to be posted is found in the queue (both events must have this component as their source). This method either returns a coalesced event which replaces the existing event (and the new event is then discarded), or null to indicate that no combining should be done (add the second event to the end of the queue). Either event parameter may be modified and returned, as the other one is discarded unless null is returned. This implementation of coalesceEvents coalesces two event types: mouse move (and drag) events, and paint (and update) events. For mouse move events the last event is always returned, causing intermediate moves to be discarded. For paint events, the new event is coalesced into a complex RepaintArea in the peer. The new AWTEvent is always returned.

					Processes component events occurring on this component by dispatching them to any registered ComponentListener objects. This method is not called unless component events are enabled for this component. Component events are enabled when one of the following occurs: A ComponentListener object is registered via addComponentListener. Component events are enabled via enableEvents. Note that if the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception.

					protected void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Processes focus events occurring on this component by dispatching them to any registered FocusListener objects. This method is not called unless focus events are enabled for this component. Focus events are enabled when one of the following occurs: A FocusListener object is registered via addFocusListener. Focus events are enabled via enableEvents. If focus events are enabled for a Component, the current KeyboardFocusManager determines whether or not a focus event should be dispatched to registered FocusListener objects. If the events are to be dispatched, the KeyboardFocusManager calls the Component's dispatchEvent method, which results in a call to the Component's processFocusEvent method. If focus events are enabled for a Component, calling the Component's dispatchEvent method with a FocusEvent as the argument will result in a call to the Component's processFocusEvent method regardless of the current KeyboardFocusManager. Note that if the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception.

					protected void processKeyEvent(KeyEvent e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Processes key events occurring on this component by dispatching them to any registered KeyListener objects. This method is not called unless key events are enabled for this component. Key events are enabled when one of the following occurs: A KeyListener object is registered via addKeyListener. Key events are enabled via enableEvents. If key events are enabled for a Component, the current KeyboardFocusManager determines whether or not a key event should be dispatched to registered KeyListener objects. The DefaultKeyboardFocusManager will not dispatch key events to a Component that is not the focus owner or is not showing. As of J2SE 1.4, KeyEvents are redirected to the focus owner. Please see the Focus Specification for further information. Calling a Component's dispatchEvent method with a KeyEvent as the argument will result in a call to the Component's processKeyEvent method regardless of the current KeyboardFocusManager as long as the component is showing, focused, and enabled, and key events are enabled on it. If the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception.

				<description>
					Sets the focus traversal keys for a given traversal operation for this Component. The default values for a Component's focus traversal keys are implementation-dependent. Sun recommends that all implementations for a particular native platform use the same default values. The recommendations for Windows and Unix are listed below. These recommendations are used in the Sun AWT implementations. Identifier Meaning Default KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS Normal forward keyboard traversal TAB on KEY_PRESSED, CTRL-TAB on KEY_PRESSED KeyboardFocusManager.BACKWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS Normal reverse keyboard traversal SHIFT-TAB on KEY_PRESSED, CTRL-SHIFT-TAB on KEY_PRESSED KeyboardFocusManager.UP_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS Go up one focus traversal cycle none To disable a traversal key, use an empty Set; Collections.EMPTY_SET is recommended. Using the AWTKeyStroke API, client code can specify on which of two specific KeyEvents, KEY_PRESSED or KEY_RELEASED, the focus traversal operation will occur. Regardless of which KeyEvent is specified, however, all KeyEvents related to the focus traversal key, including the associated KEY_TYPED event, will be consumed, and will not be dispatched to any Component. It is a runtime error to specify a KEY_TYPED event as mapping to a focus traversal operation, or to map the same event to multiple default focus traversal operations. If a value of null is specified for the Set, this Component inherits the Set from its parent. If all ancestors of this Component have null specified for the Set, then the current KeyboardFocusManager's default Set is used.

				<description>
					Requests that this Component get the input focus, and that this Component's top-level ancestor become the focused Window. This component must be displayable, focusable, visible and all of its ancestors (with the exception of the top-level Window) must be visible for the request to be granted. Every effort will be made to honor the request; however, in some cases it may be impossible to do so. Developers must never assume that this Component is the focus owner until this Component receives a FOCUS_GAINED event. If this request is denied because this Component's top-level Window cannot become the focused Window, the request will be remembered and will be granted when the Window is later focused by the user. This method cannot be used to set the focus owner to no Component at all. Use KeyboardFocusManager.clearGlobalFocusOwner() instead. Because the focus behavior of this method is platform-dependent, developers are strongly encouraged to use requestFocusInWindow when possible. Note: Not all focus transfers result from invoking this method. As such, a component may receive focus without this or any of the other requestFocus methods of Component being invoked.

Again, while a return value of true indicates that the request is likely to succeed, developers must never assume that this component is the focus owner until this component receives a FOCUS_GAINED event.

Because the focus behavior of this method is platform-dependent, developers are strongly encouraged to use requestFocusInWindow when possible. Every effort will be made to ensure that FocusEvents generated as a result of this request will have the specified temporary value. However, because specifying an arbitrary temporary state may not be implementable on all native windowing systems, correct behavior for this method can be guaranteed only for lightweight Components. This method is not intended for general use, but exists instead as a hook for lightweight component libraries, such as Swing. Note: Not all focus transfers result from invoking this method.

					public void setComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation o)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the language-sensitive orientation that is to be used to order the elements or text within this component. Language-sensitive LayoutManager and Component subclasses will use this property to determine how to lay out and draw components. At construction time, a component's orientation is set to ComponentOrientation.UNKNOWN, indicating that it has not been specified explicitly. The UNKNOWN orientation behaves the same as ComponentOrientation.LEFT_TO_RIGHT. To set the orientation of a single component, use this method. To set the orientation of an entire component hierarchy, use applyComponentOrientation. This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy.
