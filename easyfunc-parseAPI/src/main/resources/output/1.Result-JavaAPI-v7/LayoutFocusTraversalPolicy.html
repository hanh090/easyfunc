			public class LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy  extends SortingFocusTraversalPolicy  implements Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			A SortingFocusTraversalPolicy which sorts Components based on their size, position, and orientation. Based on their size and position, Components are roughly categorized into rows and columns. For a Container with horizontal orientation, columns run left-to-right or right-to-left, and rows run top- to-bottom. For a Container with vertical orientation, columns run top-to- bottom and rows run left-to-right or right-to-left. See ComponentOrientation for more information. All columns in a row are fully traversed before proceeding to the next row.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the Component that should receive the focus after aComponent. aContainer must be a focus cycle root of aComponent. By default, LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy implicitly transfers focus down- cycle. That is, during normal focus traversal, the Component traversed after a focus cycle root will be the focus-cycle-root's default Component to focus. This behavior can be disabled using the setImplicitDownCycleTraversal method. If aContainer is focus traversal policy provider, the focus is always transferred down-cycle.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicComponent많etFirstComponent(Container마Container)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the first Component in the traversal cycle. This method is used to determine the next Component to focus when traversal wraps in the forward direction.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicComponent많etLastComponent(Container마Container)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the last Component in the traversal cycle. This method is used to determine the next Component to focus when traversal wraps in the reverse direction.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected막oolean마ccept(Component마Component)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether the specified Component is an acceptable choice as the new focus owner. This method performs the following sequence of operations: Checks whether aComponent is visible, displayable, enabled, and focusable. If any of these properties is false, this method returns false. If aComponent is an instance of JTable, returns true. If aComponent is an instance of JComboBox, then returns the value of aComponent.getUI().isFocusTraversable(aComponent). If aComponent is a JComponent with a JComponent.WHEN_FOCUSED InputMap that is neither null nor empty, returns true. Returns the value of DefaultFocusTraversalPolicy.accept(aComponent).
