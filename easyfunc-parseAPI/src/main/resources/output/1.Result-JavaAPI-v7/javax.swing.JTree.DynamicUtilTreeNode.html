		<description>
			DynamicUtilTreeNode can wrap vectors/hashtables/arrays/strings and create the appropriate children tree nodes as necessary. It is dynamic in that it will only create the children as necessary. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a node with the specified object as its value and with the specified children. For the node to allow children, the children-object must be an array of objects, a Vector, or a Hashtable -- even if empty. Otherwise, the node is not allowed to have children.

				<description>
					Adds to parent all the children in children. If children is an array or vector all of its elements are added is children, otherwise if children is a hashtable all the key/value pairs are added in the order Enumeration returns them.
