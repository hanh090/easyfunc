			public final class CompletionStatus  extends Object  implements IDLEntity
		</name>
		<description>
			An object that indicates whether a method had completed running when a SystemException was thrown. The class CompletionStatus contains three CompletionStatus instances, which are constants representing each possible completion status: COMPLETED_MAYBE, COMPLETED_NO, and COMPLETED_YES. It also contains three int members, each a constant corresponding to one of the CompletionStatus instances. These int members make it possible to use a switch statement. The class also contains two methods: public int value() -- which accesses the value field of a CompletionStatus object public static CompletionStatus from_int(int i) -- for creating an instance from one of the int members
