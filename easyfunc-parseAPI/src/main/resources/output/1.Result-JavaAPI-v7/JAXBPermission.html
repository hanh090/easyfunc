		<description>
			This class is for JAXB permissions. A JAXBPermission contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but no actions list; you either have the named permission or you don't. The target name is the name of the JAXB permission (see below). The following table lists all the possible JAXBPermission target names, and for each provides a description of what the permission allows and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission. Permission Target Name What the Permission Allows Risks of Allowing this Permission setDatatypeConverter Allows the code to set VM-wide DatatypeConverterInterface via the setDatatypeConverter method that all the methods on DatatypeConverter uses. Malicious code can set DatatypeConverterInterface, which has VM-wide singleton semantics, before a genuine JAXB implementation sets one. This allows malicious code to gain access to objects that it may otherwise not have access to, such as Frame.getFrames() that belongs to another application running in the same JVM.
