		<description>
			An abstract class providing a RowSet object with its basic functionality. The basic functions include having properties and sending event notifications, which all JavaBeansTM components must implement. 1.0 Overview The BaseRowSet class provides the core functionality for all RowSet implementations, and all standard implementations may use this class in combination with one or more RowSet interfaces in order to provide a standard vendor-specific implementation. To clarify, all implementations must implement at least one of the RowSet interfaces (JdbcRowSet, CachedRowSet, JoinRowSet, FilteredRowSet, or WebRowSet). This means that any implementation that extends the BaseRowSet class must also implement one of the RowSet interfaces. The BaseRowSet class provides the following: Properties Fields for storing current properties Methods for getting and setting properties Event notification A complete set of setter methods for setting the parameters in a RowSet object's command Streams Fields for storing stream instances Constants for indicating the type of a stream 2.0 Setting Properties All rowsets maintain a set of properties, which will usually be set using a tool. The number and kinds of properties a rowset has will vary, depending on what the RowSet implementation does and how it gets its data. For example, rowsets that get their data from a ResultSet object need to set the properties that are required for making a database connection. If a RowSet object uses the DriverManager facility to make a connection, it needs to set a property for the JDBC URL that identifies the appropriate driver, and it needs to set the properties that give the user name and password. If, on the other hand, the rowset uses a DataSource object to make the connection, which is the preferred method, it does not need to set the property for the JDBC URL. Instead, it needs to set the property for the logical name of the data source along with the properties for the user name and password. NOTE: In order to use a DataSource object for making a connection, the DataSource object must have been registered with a naming service that uses the Java Naming and Directory InterfaceTM (JNDI) API. This registration is usually done by a person acting in the capacity of a system administrator. 3.0 Setting the Command and Its Parameters When a rowset gets its data from a relational database, it executes a command (a query) that produces a ResultSet object. This query is the command that is set for the RowSet object's command property. The rowset populates itself with data by reading the data from the ResultSet object into itself. If the query contains placeholders for values to be set, the BaseRowSet setter methods are used to set these values. All setter methods allow these values to be set to null if required. The following code fragment illustrates how the CachedRowSetTM object crs might have its command property set. Note that if a tool is used to set properties, this is the code that the tool would use.       crs.setCommand("SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +                     "WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > ? AND REGION = ?");   In this example, the values for CREDIT_LIMIT and REGION are placeholder parameters, which are indicated with a question mark (?). The first question mark is placeholder parameter number 1, the second question mark is placeholder parameter number 2, and so on. Any placeholder parameters must be set with values before the query can be executed. To set these placeholder parameters, the BaseRowSet class provides a set of setter methods, similar to those provided by the PreparedStatement interface, for setting values of each data type. A RowSet object stores the parameter values internally, and its execute method uses them internally to set values for the placeholder parameters before it sends the command to the DBMS to be executed. The following code fragment demonstrates setting the two parameters in the query from the previous example.       crs.setInt(1, 5000);      crs.setString(2, "West");   If the execute method is called at this point, the query sent to the DBMS will be:       "SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, ADDRESS FROM CUSTOMERS" +                     "WHERE CREDIT_LIMIT > 5000 AND REGION = 'West'"   NOTE: Setting Array, Clob, Blob and Ref objects as a command parameter, stores these values as SerialArray, SerialClob, SerialBlob and SerialRef objects respectively. 4.0 Handling of Parameters Behind the Scenes NOTE: The BaseRowSet class provides two kinds of setter methods, those that set properties and those that set placeholder parameters. The setter methods discussed in this section are those that set placeholder parameters. The placeholder parameters set with the BaseRowSet setter methods are stored as objects in an internal Hashtable object. Primitives are stored as their Object type. For example, byte is stored as Byte object, and int is stored as an Integer object. When the method execute is called, the values in the Hashtable object are substituted for the appropriate placeholder parameters in the command. A call to the method getParams returns the values stored in the Hashtable object as an array of Object instances. An element in this array may be a simple Object instance or an array (which is a type of Object). The particular setter method used determines whether an element in this array is an Object or an array. The majority of methods for setting placeholder parameters take two parameters, with the first parameter indicating which placeholder parameter is to be set, and the second parameter giving the value to be set. Methods such as setInt, setString, setBoolean, and setLong fall into this category. After these methods have been called, a call to the method getParams will return an array with the values that have been set. Each element in the array is an Object instance representing the values that have been set. The order of these values in the array is determined by the int (the first parameter) passed to the setter method. The values in the array are the values (the second parameter) passed to the setter method. In other words, the first element in the array is the value to be set for the first placeholder parameter in the RowSet object's command. The second element is the value to be set for the second placeholder parameter, and so on. Several setter methods send the driver and DBMS information beyond the value to be set. When the method getParams is called after one of these setter methods has been used, the elements in the array will themselves be arrays to accommodate the additional information. In this category, the method setNull is a special case because one version takes only two parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int SqlType)). Nevertheless, it requires an array to contain the information that will be passed to the driver and DBMS. The first element in this array is the value to be set, which is null, and the second element is the int supplied for sqlType, which indicates the type of SQL value that is being set to null. This information is needed by some DBMSs and is therefore required in order to ensure that applications are portable. The other version is intended to be used when the value to be set to null is a user-defined type. It takes three parameters (setNull(int parameterIndex, int sqlType, String typeName)) and also requires an array to contain the information to be passed to the driver and DBMS. The first two elements in this array are the same as for the first version of setNull. The third element, typeName, gives the SQL name of the user-defined type. As is true with the other setter methods, the number of the placeholder parameter to be set is indicated by an element's position in the array returned by getParams. So, for example, if the parameter supplied to setNull is 2, the second element in the array returned by getParams will be an array of two or three elements. Some methods, such as setObject and setDate have versions that take more than two parameters, with the extra parameters giving information to the driver or the DBMS. For example, the methods setDate, setTime, and setTimestamp can take a Calendar object as their third parameter. If the DBMS does not store time zone information, the drivern uses the Calendar object to construct the Date, Time, or Timestamp object being set. As is true with other methods that provide additional information, the element in the array returned by getParams is an array instead of a simple Object instance. The methods setAsciiStream, setBinaryStream, setCharacterStream, and setUnicodeStream (which is deprecated, so applications should use getCharacterStream instead) take three parameters, so for them, the element in the array returned by getParams is also an array. What is different about these setter methods is that in addition to the information provided by parameters, the array contains one of the BaseRowSet constants indicating the type of stream being set. NOTE: The method getParams is called internally by RowSet implementations extending this class; it is not normally called by an application programmer directly. 5.0 Event Notification The BaseRowSet class provides the event notification mechanism for rowsets. It contains the field listeners, methods for adding and removing listeners, and methods for notifying listeners of changes. A listener is an object that has implemented the RowSetListener interface. If it has been added to a RowSet object's list of listeners, it will be notified when an event occurs on that RowSet object. Each listener's implementation of the RowSetListener methods defines what that object will do when it is notified that an event has occurred. There are three possible events for a RowSet object: the cursor moves an individual row is changed (updated, deleted, or inserted) the contents of the entire RowSet object are changed The BaseRowSet method used for the notification indicates the type of event that has occurred. For example, the method notifyRowChanged indicates that a row has been updated, deleted, or inserted. Each of the notification methods creates a RowSetEvent object, which is supplied to the listener in order to identify the RowSet object on which the event occurred. What the listener does with this information, which may be nothing, depends on how it was implemented. 6.0 Default Behavior A default BaseRowSet object is initialized with many starting values. The following is true of a default RowSet instance that extends the BaseRowSet class: Has a scrollable cursor and does not show changes made by others. Is updatable. Does not show rows that have been deleted. Has no time limit for how long a driver may take to execute the RowSet object's command. Has no limit for the number of rows it may contain. Has no limit for the number of bytes a column may contain. NOTE: This limit applies only to columns that hold values of the following types: BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, CHAR, VARCHAR, and LONGVARCHAR. Will not see uncommitted data (make "dirty" reads). Has escape processing turned on. Has its connection's type map set to null. Has an empty Vector object for storing the values set for the placeholder parameters in the RowSet object's command. If other values are desired, an application must set the property values explicitly. For example, the following line of code sets the maximum number of rows for the CachedRowSet object crs to 500.       crs.setMaxRows(500);   Methods implemented in extensions of this BaseRowSet class must throw an SQLException object for any violation of the defined assertions. Also, if the extending class overrides and reimplements any BaseRowSet method and encounters connectivity or underlying data source issues, that method may in addition throw an SQLException object for that reason.

				</name>
				<description>
					Notifies all of the listeners registered with this RowSet object that one of its rows has changed. When an application calls a method that changes a row, such as the CachedRowSet methods insertRow, updateRow, or deleteRow, that method calls notifyRowChanged internally. An application should never invoke this method directly.
				</description>

				<description>
					Notifies all of the listeners registered with this RowSet object that its entire contents have changed. When an application calls methods that change the entire contents of the RowSet object, such as the CachedRowSet methods execute, populate, restoreOriginal, or release, that method calls notifyRowSetChanged internally (either directly or indirectly). An application should never invoke this method directly.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getCommand()
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the SQL query that is the command for this RowSet object. The command property contains the query that will be executed to populate this RowSet object. The SQL query returned by this method is used by RowSet methods such as execute and populate, which may be implemented by any class that extends the BaseRowSet abstract class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces. The command is used by the RowSet object's reader to obtain a ResultSet object. The reader then reads the data from the ResultSet object and uses it to to populate this RowSet object. The default value for the command property is null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setCommand(String cmd)                  throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets this RowSet object's command property to the given String object and clears the parameters, if any, that were set for the previous command. The command property may not be needed if the RowSet object gets its data from a source that does not support commands, such as a spreadsheet or other tabular file. Thus, this property is optional and may be null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getUrl()                throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the JDBC URL that this RowSet object's javax.sql.Reader object uses to make a connection with a relational database using a JDBC technology-enabled driver. The Url property will be null if the underlying data source is a non-SQL data source, such as a spreadsheet or an XML data source.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setUrl(String url)              throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the Url property for this RowSet object to the given String object and sets the dataSource name property to null. The Url property is a JDBC URL that is used when the connection is created using a JDBC technology-enabled driver ("JDBC driver") and the DriverManager. The correct JDBC URL for the specific driver to be used can be found in the driver documentation. Although there are guidelines for for how a JDBC URL is formed, a driver vendor can specify any String object except one with a length of 0 (an empty string). Setting the Url property is optional if connections are established using a DataSource object instead of the DriverManager. The driver will use either the URL property or the dataSourceName property to create a connection, whichever was specified most recently. If an application uses a JDBC URL, it must load a JDBC driver that accepts the JDBC URL before it uses the RowSet object to connect to a database. The RowSet object will use the URL internally to create a database connection in order to read or write data.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getDataSourceName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the logical name that when supplied to a naming service that uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API, will retrieve a javax.sql.DataSource object. This DataSource object can be used to establish a connection to the data source that it represents. Users should set either the url or the data source name property. The driver will use the property set most recently to establish a connection.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setDataSourceName(String name)                         throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the DataSource name property for this RowSet object to the given logical name and sets this RowSet object's Url property to null. The name must have been bound to a DataSource object in a JNDI naming service so that an application can do a lookup using that name to retrieve the DataSource object bound to it. The DataSource object can then be used to establish a connection to the data source it represents. Users should set either the Url property or the dataSourceName property. If both properties are set, the driver will use the property set most recently.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getUsername()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the user name used to create a database connection. Because it is not serialized, the username property is set at runtime before calling the method execute.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setPassword(String pass)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the password used to create a database connection for this RowSet object to the given String object. Because the password property is not serialized, it is set at run time before calling the method execute.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isReadOnly()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a boolean indicating whether this RowSet object is read-only. Any attempts to update a read-only RowSet object will result in an SQLException being thrown. By default, rowsets are updatable if updates are possible.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setReadOnly(boolean value)
				</name>
				<description>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getTransactionIsolation()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the transaction isolation property for this RowSet object's connection. This property represents the transaction isolation level requested for use in transactions. For RowSet implementations such as the CachedRowSet that operate in a disconnected environment, the SyncProvider object offers complementary locking and data integrity options. The options described below are pertinent only to connected RowSet objects (JdbcRowSet objects).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setTransactionIsolation(int level)                               throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the transaction isolation property for this JDBC RowSet object to the given constant. The DBMS will use this transaction isolation level for transactions if it can. For RowSet implementations such as the CachedRowSet that operate in a disconnected environment, the SyncProvider object being used offers complementary locking and data integrity options. The options described below are pertinent only to connected RowSet objects (JdbcRowSet objects).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Map<String,Class<?>> getTypeMap()
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the type map associated with the Connection object for this RowSet object. Drivers that support the JDBC 3.0 API will create Connection objects with an associated type map. This type map, which is initially empty, can contain one or more fully-qualified SQL names and Class objects indicating the class to which the named SQL value will be mapped. The type mapping specified in the connection's type map is used for custom type mapping when no other type map supersedes it. If a type map is explicitly supplied to a method that can perform custom mapping, that type map supersedes the connection's type map.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setTypeMap(Map<String,Class<?>> map)
				</name>
				<description>
					Installs the given java.util.Map object as the type map associated with the Connection object for this RowSet object. The custom mapping indicated in this type map will be used unless a different type map is explicitly supplied to a method, in which case the type map supplied will be used.
				</description>

				<name>
					public int getMaxFieldSize()                      throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the maximum number of bytes that can be used for a column value in this RowSet object. This limit applies only to columns that hold values of the following types: BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, CHAR, VARCHAR, and LONGVARCHAR. If the limit is exceeded, the excess data is silently discarded.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setMaxRows(int max)                  throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the maximum number of rows that this RowSet object may contain to the given number. If this limit is exceeded, the excess rows are silently dropped.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setEscapeProcessing(boolean enable)                           throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets to the given boolean whether or not the driver will scan for escape syntax and do escape substitution before sending SQL statements to the database. The default is for the driver to do escape processing. Note: Since PreparedStatement objects have usually been parsed prior to making this call, disabling escape processing for prepared statements will likely have no effect.
				</description>

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets to the given number the maximum number of seconds the driver will wait for a query to execute. If the limit is exceeded, an SQLException is thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getShowDeleted()                         throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves a boolean indicating whether rows marked for deletion appear in the set of current rows. The default value is false. Note: Allowing deleted rows to remain visible complicates the behavior of some of the methods. However, most RowSet object users can simply ignore this extra detail because only sophisticated applications will likely want to take advantage of this feature.
				</description>
				
			</method>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getEscapeProcessing()                              throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Ascertains whether escape processing is enabled for this RowSet object.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setFetchDirection(int direction)                         throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Gives the driver a performance hint as to the direction in which the rows in this RowSet object will be processed. The driver may ignore this hint. A RowSet object inherits the default properties of the ResultSet object from which it got its data. That ResultSet object's default fetch direction is set by the Statement object that created it. This method applies to a RowSet object only while it is connected to a database using a JDBC driver. A RowSet object may use this method at any time to change its setting for the fetch direction.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the fetch size for this RowSet object to the given number of rows. The fetch size gives a JDBC technology-enabled driver ("JDBC driver") a hint as to the number of rows that should be fetched from the database when more rows are needed for this RowSet object. If the fetch size specified is zero, the driver ignores the value and is free to make its own best guess as to what the fetch size should be. A RowSet object inherits the default properties of the ResultSet object from which it got its data. That ResultSet object's default fetch size is set by the Statement object that created it. This method applies to a RowSet object only while it is connected to a database using a JDBC driver. For connected RowSet implementations such as JdbcRowSet, this method has a direct and immediate effect on the underlying JDBC driver. A RowSet object may use this method at any time to change its setting for the fetch size. For RowSet implementations such as CachedRowSet, which operate in a disconnected environment, the SyncProvider object being used may leverage the fetch size to poll the data source and retrieve a number of rows that do not exceed the fetch size and that may form a subset of the actual rows returned by the original query. This is an implementation variance determined by the specific SyncProvider object employed by the disconnected RowSet object.

					public void setNull(int parameterIndex,             int sqlType)               throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the designated parameter to SQL NULL. Note that the parameter's SQL type must be specified using one of the type codes defined in java.sql.Types. This SQL type is specified in the second parameter. Note that the second parameter tells the DBMS the data type of the value being set to NULL. Some DBMSs require this information, so it is required in order to make code more portable. The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this RowSet object's command when the method execute is called. Methods such as execute and populate must be provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces. NOTE: JdbcRowSet does not require the populate method as it is undefined in this class. Calls made to the method getParams after this version of setNull has been called will return an Object array containing the parameter values that have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array is null. The second element is the value set for sqlType. The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array returned by the method getParams, with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on. In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to null, the array containing it will be the second element in the array returned by getParams. Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero, the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number parameterIndex is parameterIndex -1.

				<description>
					Sets the designated parameter to SQL NULL. Although this version of the method setNull is intended for user-defined and REF parameters, this method may be used to set a null parameter for any JDBC type. The following are user-defined types: STRUCT, DISTINCT, and JAVA_OBJECT, and named array types. Note: To be portable, applications must give the SQL type code and the fully qualified SQL type name when specifying a NULL user-defined or REF parameter. In the case of a user-defined type, the name is the type name of the parameter itself. For a REF parameter, the name is the type name of the referenced type. If a JDBC technology-enabled driver does not need the type code or type name information, it may ignore it. If the parameter does not have a user-defined or REF type, the given typeName parameter is ignored. The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this RowSet object's command when the method execute is called. Methods such as execute and populate must be provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces.

					Sets the designated parameter to an Object in the Java programming language. The second parameter must be an Object type. For integral values, the java.lang equivalent objects should be used. For example, use the class Integer for an int. The driver converts this object to the specified target SQL type before sending it to the database. If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing SQLData), the driver should call the method SQLData.writeSQL to write the object to the SQL data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing Ref, Blob, Clob, Struct, or Array, the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the corresponding SQL type. Note that this method may be used to pass database- specific abstract data types. The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this RowSetexecute is called. Methods such as execute and populate must be provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces. NOTE: JdbcRowSet does not require the populate method as it is undefined in this class. Calls made to the method getParams after this version of setObject has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that have been set. In that array, the element that represents the values set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array is the given Object instance, and the second element is the value set for targetSqlType. The third element is the value set for scale, which the driver will ignore if the type of the object being set is not java.sql.Types.NUMERIC or java.sql.Types.DECIMAL. The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array returned by the method getParams, with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on. In other words, if the object being set is the value for the second placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in the array returned by getParams. Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero, the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number parameterIndex is element number parameterIndex -1.

				<description>
					Sets the designated parameter to an Object in the Java programming language. The second parameter must be an Object type. For integral values, the java.lang equivalent objects should be used. For example, use the class Integer for an int. The JDBC specification defines a standard mapping from Java Object types to SQL types. The driver will use this standard mapping to convert the given object to its corresponding SQL type before sending it to the database. If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing SQLData), the driver should call the method SQLData.writeSQL to write the object to the SQL data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing Ref, Blob, Clob, Struct, or Array, the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the corresponding SQL type. This method throws an exception if there is an ambiguity, for example, if the object is of a class implementing more than one interface. Note that this method may be used to pass database-specific abstract data types. The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this RowSet object's command when the method execute is called. Methods such as execute and populate must be provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces. NOTE: JdbcRowSet does not require the populate method as it is undefined in this class. After this method has been called, a call to the method getParams will return an object array of the current command parameters, which will include the Object set for placeholder parameter number parameterIndex. Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero, the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number parameterIndex is element number parameterIndex -1.

				<description>
					Clears all of the current parameter values in this RowSet object's internal representation of the parameters to be set in this RowSet object's command when it is executed. In general, parameter values remain in force for repeated use in this RowSet object's command. Setting a parameter value with the setter methods automatically clears the value of the designated parameter and replaces it with the new specified value. This method is called internally by the setCommand method to clear all of the parameters set for the previous command. Furthermore, this method differs from the initParams method in that it maintains the schema of the RowSet object.

				<description>
					Retrieves an array containing the parameter values (both Objects and primitives) that have been set for this RowSet object's command and throws an SQLException object if all parameters have not been set. Before the command is sent to the DBMS to be executed, these parameters will be substituted for placeholder parameters in the PreparedStatement object that is the command for a RowSet implementation extending the BaseRowSet class. Each element in the array that is returned is an Object instance that contains the values of the parameters supplied to a setter method. The order of the elements is determined by the value supplied for parameterIndex. If the setter method takes only the parameter index and the value to be set (possibly null), the array element will contain the value to be set (which will be expressed as an Object). If there are additional parameters, the array element will itself be an array containing the value to be set plus any additional parameter values supplied to the setter method. If the method sets a stream, the array element includes the type of stream being supplied to the method. These additional parameters are for the use of the driver or the DBMS and may or may not be used. NOTE: Stored parameter values of types Array, Blob, Clob and Ref are returned as SerialArray, SerialBlob, SerialClob and SerialRef respectively.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the designated parameter to SQL NULL. This version of the method setNull should be used for user-defined types and REF type parameters. Examples of user-defined types include: STRUCT, DISTINCT, JAVA_OBJECT, and named array types. Note: To be portable, applications must give the SQL type code and the fully-qualified SQL type name when specifying a NULL user-defined or REF parameter. In the case of a user-defined type the name is the type name of the parameter itself. For a REF parameter, the name is the type name of the referenced type. If a JDBC driver does not need the type code or type name information, it may ignore it. Although it is intended for user-defined and Ref parameters, this method may be used to set a null parameter of any JDBC type. If the parameter does not have a user-defined or REF type, the given typeName is ignored.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object. The second argument must be an object type; for integral values, the java.lang equivalent objects should be used. The given Java object will be converted to the given targetSqlType before being sent to the database. If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing the interface SQLData), the JDBC driver should call the method SQLData.writeSQL to write it to the SQL data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing Ref, Blob, Clob, NClob, Struct, java.net.URL, or Array, the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the corresponding SQL type. Note that this method may be used to pass datatabase- specific abstract data types.

					public void setObject(String parameterName,               Object x)                 throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the value of the designated parameter with the given object. The second parameter must be of type Object; therefore, the java.lang equivalent objects should be used for built-in types. The JDBC specification specifies a standard mapping from Java Object types to SQL types. The given argument will be converted to the corresponding SQL type before being sent to the database. Note that this method may be used to pass datatabase- specific abstract data types, by using a driver-specific Java type. If the object is of a class implementing the interface SQLData, the JDBC driver should call the method SQLData.writeSQL to write it to the SQL data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing Ref, Blob, Clob, NClob, Struct, java.net.URL, or Array, the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the corresponding SQL type. This method throws an exception if there is an ambiguity, for example, if the object is of a class implementing more than one of the interfaces named above.

				<description>
					Sets the designated parameter to a InputStream object. The inputstream must contain the number of characters specified by length otherwise a SQLException will be generated when the PreparedStatement is executed. This method differs from the setBinaryStream (int, InputStream, int) method because it informs the driver that the parameter value should be sent to the server as a BLOB.
