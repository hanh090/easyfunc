		</name>
		<description>
			An action that assumes it's being fired on a JEditorPane with a StyledEditorKit (or subclass) installed. This has some convenience methods for causing character or paragraph level attribute changes. The convenience methods will throw an IllegalArgumentException if the assumption of a StyledDocument, a JEditorPane, or a StyledEditorKit fail to be true. The component that gets acted upon by the action will be the source of the ActionEvent if the source can be narrowed to a JEditorPane type. If the source can't be narrowed, the most recently focused text component is changed. If neither of these are the case, the action cannot be performed. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
