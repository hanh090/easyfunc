		<description>
			This interface is the type signature that is expected to be present on any attribute key that contributes to the determination of what font to use to render some text. This is not considered to be a closed set, the definition can change across version of the platform and can be amended by additional user added entries that correspond to logical settings that are specific to some type of content.
