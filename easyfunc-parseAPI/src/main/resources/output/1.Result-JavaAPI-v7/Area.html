		</name>
		<description>
			An Area object stores and manipulates a resolution-independent description of an enclosed area of 2-dimensional space. Area objects can be transformed and can perform various Constructive Area Geometry (CAG) operations when combined with other Area objects. The CAG operations include area addition, subtraction, intersection, and exclusive or. See the linked method documentation for examples of the various operations. The Area class implements the Shape interface and provides full support for all of its hit-testing and path iteration facilities, but an Area is more specific than a generalized path in a number of ways: Only closed paths and sub-paths are stored. Area objects constructed from unclosed paths are implicitly closed during construction as if those paths had been filled by the Graphics2D.fill method. The interiors of the individual stored sub-paths are all non-empty and non-overlapping. Paths are decomposed during construction into separate component non-overlapping parts, empty pieces of the path are discarded, and then these non-empty and non-overlapping properties are maintained through all subsequent CAG operations. Outlines of different component sub-paths may touch each other, as long as they do not cross so that their enclosed areas overlap. The geometry of the path describing the outline of the Area resembles the path from which it was constructed only in that it describes the same enclosed 2-dimensional area, but may use entirely different types and ordering of the path segments to do so. Interesting issues which are not always obvious when using the Area include: Creating an Area from an unclosed (open) Shape results in a closed outline in the Area object. Creating an Area from a Shape which encloses no area (even when "closed") produces an empty Area. A common example of this issue is that producing an Area from a line will be empty since the line encloses no area. An empty Area will iterate no geometry in its PathIterator objects. A self-intersecting Shape may be split into two (or more) sub-paths each enclosing one of the non-intersecting portions of the original path. An Area may take more path segments to describe the same geometry even when the original outline is simple and obvious. The analysis that the Area class must perform on the path may not reflect the same concepts of "simple and obvious" as a human being perceives.

				<description>
					Returns a high precision bounding Rectangle2D that completely encloses this Area. The Area class will attempt to return the tightest bounding box possible for the Shape.

The bounding box will not be padded to include the control points of curves in the outline of the Shape, but should tightly fit the actual geometry of the outline itself. Since the returned object represents the bounding box with integers, the bounding box can only be as tight as the nearest integer coordinates that encompass the geometry of the Shape.

				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape entirely contains the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside the rectangular area must lie within the Shape for the entire rectanglar area to be considered contained within the Shape. The Shape.contains() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return false when: the intersect method returns true and the calculations to determine whether or not the Shape entirely contains the rectangular area are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return false even though the Shape contains the rectangular area. The Area class performs more accurate geometric computations than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.

				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape intersects the interior of a specified rectangular area. The rectangular area is considered to intersect the Shape if any point is contained in both the interior of the Shape and the specified rectangular area. The Shape.intersects() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return true when: there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the Shape intersect, but the calculations to accurately determine this intersection are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return true even though the rectangular area does not intersect the Shape. The Area class performs more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.
