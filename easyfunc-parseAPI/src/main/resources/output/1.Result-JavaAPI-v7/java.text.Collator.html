		<description>
			The Collator class performs locale-sensitive String comparison. You use this class to build searching and sorting routines for natural language text. Collator is an abstract base class. Subclasses implement specific collation strategies. One subclass, RuleBasedCollator, is currently provided with the Java Platform and is applicable to a wide set of languages. Other subclasses may be created to handle more specialized needs. Like other locale-sensitive classes, you can use the static factory method, getInstance, to obtain the appropriate Collator object for a given locale. You will only need to look at the subclasses of Collator if you need to understand the details of a particular collation strategy or if you need to modify that strategy. The following example shows how to compare two strings using the Collator for the default locale.    // Compare two strings in the default locale   Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();   if( myCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") < 0 )       System.out.println("abc is less than ABC");   else       System.out.println("abc is greater than or equal to ABC");   You can set a Collator's strength property to determine the level of difference considered significant in comparisons. Four strengths are provided: PRIMARY, SECONDARY, TERTIARY, and IDENTICAL. The exact assignment of strengths to language features is locale dependant. For example, in Czech, "e" and "f" are considered primary differences, while "e" and "?" are secondary differences, "e" and "E" are tertiary differences and "e" and "e" are identical. The following shows how both case and accents could be ignored for US English.    //Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY   Collator usCollator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);   usCollator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);   if( usCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") == 0 ) {       System.out.println("Strings are equivalent");   }   For comparing Strings exactly once, the compare method provides the best performance. When sorting a list of Strings however, it is generally necessary to compare each String multiple times. In this case, CollationKeys provide better performance. The CollationKey class converts a String to a series of bits that can be compared bitwise against other CollationKeys. A CollationKey is created by a Collator object for a given String. Note: CollationKeys from different Collators can not be compared. See the class description for CollationKey for an example using CollationKeys.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int PRIMARY
				</name>
				<description>
					Collator strength value. When set, only PRIMARY differences are considered significant during comparison. The assignment of strengths to language features is locale dependant. A common example is for different base letters ("a" vs "b") to be considered a PRIMARY difference.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int SECONDARY
				</name>
				<description>
					Collator strength value. When set, only SECONDARY and above differences are considered significant during comparison. The assignment of strengths to language features is locale dependant. A common example is for different accented forms of the same base letter ("a" vs "?") to be considered a SECONDARY difference.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int TERTIARY
				</name>
				<description>
					Collator strength value. When set, only TERTIARY and above differences are considered significant during comparison. The assignment of strengths to language features is locale dependant. A common example is for case differences ("a" vs "A") to be considered a TERTIARY difference.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int IDENTICAL
				</name>
				<description>
					Collator strength value. When set, all differences are considered significant during comparison. The assignment of strengths to language features is locale dependant. A common example is for control characters ("\u0001" vs "\u0002") to be considered equal at the PRIMARY, SECONDARY, and TERTIARY levels but different at the IDENTICAL level. Additionally, differences between pre-composed accents such as "\u00C0" (A-grave) and combining accents such as "A\u0300" (A, combining-grave) will be considered significant at the IDENTICAL level if decomposition is set to NO_DECOMPOSITION.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int NO_DECOMPOSITION
				</name>
				<description>
					Decomposition mode value. With NO_DECOMPOSITION set, accented characters will not be decomposed for collation. This is the default setting and provides the fastest collation but will only produce correct results for languages that do not use accents.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION
				</name>
				<description>
					Decomposition mode value. With CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION set, characters that are canonical variants according to Unicode standard will be decomposed for collation. This should be used to get correct collation of accented characters. CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION corresponds to Normalization Form D as described in Unicode Technical Report #15.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int FULL_DECOMPOSITION
				</name>
				<description>
					Decomposition mode value. With FULL_DECOMPOSITION set, both Unicode canonical variants and Unicode compatibility variants will be decomposed for collation. This causes not only accented characters to be collated, but also characters that have special formats to be collated with their norminal form. For example, the half-width and full-width ASCII and Katakana characters are then collated together. FULL_DECOMPOSITION is the most complete and therefore the slowest decomposition mode. FULL_DECOMPOSITION corresponds to Normalization Form KD as described in Unicode Technical Report #15.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Collator()
				</name>
				<description>
					Default constructor. This constructor is protected so subclasses can get access to it. Users typically create a Collator sub-class by calling the factory method getInstance.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Collator getInstance()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the Collator for the current default locale. The default locale is determined by java.util.Locale.getDefault.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Collator getInstance(Locale desiredLocale)
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the Collator for the desired locale.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract int compare(String source,            String target)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares the source string to the target string according to the collation rules for this Collator. Returns an integer less than, equal to or greater than zero depending on whether the source String is less than, equal to or greater than the target string. See the Collator class description for an example of use. For a one time comparison, this method has the best performance. If a given String will be involved in multiple comparisons, CollationKey.compareTo has the best performance. See the Collator class description for an example using CollationKeys.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int compare(Object o1,            Object o2)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares its two arguments for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. This implementation merely returns compare((String)o1, (String)o2) .
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract CollationKey getCollationKey(String source)
				</name>
				<description>
					Transforms the String into a series of bits that can be compared bitwise to other CollationKeys. CollationKeys provide better performance than Collator.compare when Strings are involved in multiple comparisons. See the Collator class description for an example using CollationKeys.
