		<description>
			The ColorModel abstract class encapsulates the methods for translating a pixel value to color components (for example, red, green, and blue) and an alpha component. In order to render an image to the screen, a printer, or another image, pixel values must be converted to color and alpha components. As arguments to or return values from methods of this class, pixels are represented as 32-bit ints or as arrays of primitive types. The number, order, and interpretation of color components for a ColorModel is specified by its ColorSpace. A ColorModel used with pixel data that does not include alpha information treats all pixels as opaque, which is an alpha value of 1.0. This ColorModel class supports two representations of pixel values. A pixel value can be a single 32-bit int or an array of primitive types. The Java(tm) Platform 1.0 and 1.1 APIs represented pixels as single byte or single int values. For purposes of the ColorModel class, pixel value arguments were passed as ints. The Java(tm) 2 Platform API introduced additional classes for representing images. With BufferedImage or RenderedImage objects, based on Raster and SampleModel classes, pixel values might not be conveniently representable as a single int. Consequently, ColorModel now has methods that accept pixel values represented as arrays of primitive types. The primitive type used by a particular ColorModel object is called its transfer type. ColorModel objects used with images for which pixel values are not conveniently representable as a single int throw an IllegalArgumentException when methods taking a single int pixel argument are called. Subclasses of ColorModel must specify the conditions under which this occurs. This does not occur with DirectColorModel or IndexColorModel objects. Currently, the transfer types supported by the Java 2D(tm) API are DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_INT, DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT, and DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE. Most rendering operations will perform much faster when using ColorModels and images based on the first three of these types. In addition, some image filtering operations are not supported for ColorModels and images based on the latter three types. The transfer type for a particular ColorModel object is specified when the object is created, either explicitly or by default. All subclasses of ColorModel must specify what the possible transfer types are and how the number of elements in the primitive arrays representing pixels is determined. For BufferedImages, the transfer type of its Raster and of the Raster object's SampleModel (available from the getTransferType methods of these classes) must match that of the ColorModel. The number of elements in an array representing a pixel for the Raster and SampleModel (available from the getNumDataElements methods of these classes) must match that of the ColorModel. The algorithm used to convert from pixel values to color and alpha components varies by subclass. For example, there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between samples obtained from the SampleModel of a BufferedImage object's Raster and color/alpha components. Even when there is such a correspondence, the number of bits in a sample is not necessarily the same as the number of bits in the corresponding color/alpha component. Each subclass must specify how the translation from pixel values to color/alpha components is done. Methods in the ColorModel class use two different representations of color and alpha components - a normalized form and an unnormalized form. In the normalized form, each component is a float value between some minimum and maximum values. For the alpha component, the minimum is 0.0 and the maximum is 1.0. For color components the minimum and maximum values for each component can be obtained from the ColorSpace object. These values will often be 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g. normalized component values for the default sRGB color space range from 0.0 to 1.0), but some color spaces have component values with different upper and lower limits. These limits can be obtained using the getMinValue and getMaxValue methods of the ColorSpace class. Normalized color component values are not premultiplied. All ColorModels must support the normalized form. In the unnormalized form, each component is an unsigned integral value between 0 and 2n - 1, where n is the number of significant bits for a particular component. If pixel values for a particular ColorModel represent color samples premultiplied by the alpha sample, unnormalized color component values are also premultiplied. The unnormalized form is used only with instances of ColorModel whose ColorSpace has minimum component values of 0.0 for all components and maximum values of 1.0 for all components. The unnormalized form for color and alpha components can be a convenient representation for ColorModels whose normalized component values all lie between 0.0 and 1.0. In such cases the integral value 0 maps to 0.0 and the value 2n - 1 maps to 1.0. In other cases, such as when the normalized component values can be either negative or positive, the unnormalized form is not convenient. Such ColorModel objects throw an IllegalArgumentException when methods involving an unnormalized argument are called. Subclasses of ColorModel must specify the conditions under which this occurs.

				<description>
					Constructs a ColorModel that translates pixels of the specified number of bits to color/alpha components. The color space is the default RGB ColorSpace, which is sRGB. Pixel values are assumed to include alpha information. If color and alpha information are represented in the pixel value as separate spatial bands, the color bands are assumed not to be premultiplied with the alpha value. The transparency type is java.awt.Transparency.TRANSLUCENT. The transfer type will be the smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel (or DataBuffer.TYPE_UNDEFINED if bits is greater than 32). Since this constructor has no information about the number of bits per color and alpha component, any subclass calling this constructor should override any method that requires this information.

					Constructs a ColorModel that translates pixel values to color/alpha components. Color components will be in the specified ColorSpace. pixel_bits is the number of bits in the pixel values. The bits array specifies the number of significant bits per color and alpha component. Its length should be the number of components in the ColorSpace if there is no alpha information in the pixel values, or one more than this number if there is alpha information. hasAlpha indicates whether or not alpha information is present. The boolean isAlphaPremultiplied specifies how to interpret pixel values in which color and alpha information are represented as separate spatial bands. If the boolean is true, color samples are assumed to have been multiplied by the alpha sample. The transparency specifies what alpha values can be represented by this color model. The transfer type is the type of primitive array used to represent pixel values. Note that the bits array contains the number of significant bits per color/alpha component after the translation from pixel values. For example, for an IndexColorModel with pixel_bits equal to 16, the bits array might have four elements with each element set to 8.

				<description>
					Returns a DirectColorModel that describes the default format for integer RGB values used in many of the methods in the AWT image interfaces for the convenience of the programmer. The color space is the default ColorSpace, sRGB. The format for the RGB values is an integer with 8 bits each of alpha, red, green, and blue color components ordered correspondingly from the most significant byte to the least significant byte, as in: 0xAARRGGBB. Color components are not premultiplied by the alpha component. This format does not necessarily represent the native or the most efficient ColorModel for a particular device or for all images. It is merely used as a common color model format.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of all of the color/alpha components in normalized form, given a pixel in this ColorModel. The pixel value is specified by an array of data elements of type transferType passed in as an object reference. If pixel is not a primitive array of type transferType, a ClassCastException is thrown. An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if pixel is not large enough to hold a pixel value for this ColorModel. Normalized components are float values between a per component minimum and maximum specified by the ColorSpace object for this ColorModel. If the normComponents array is null, a new array will be allocated. The normComponents array will be returned. Color/alpha components are stored in the normComponents array starting at normOffset (even if the array is allocated by this method). An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if the normComponents array is not null and is not large enough to hold all the color and alpha components (starting at normOffset). Since ColorModel is an abstract class, any instance is an instance of a subclass. The default implementation of this method in this abstract class first retrieves color and alpha components in the unnormalized form using getComponents(Object, int[], int) and then calls getNormalizedComponents(int[], int, float[], int). Subclasses which may have instances which do not support the unnormalized form must override this method.

				</name>
				<description>
					Forces the raster data to match the state specified in the isAlphaPremultiplied variable, assuming the data is currently correctly described by this ColorModel. It may multiply or divide the color raster data by alpha, or do nothing if the data is in the correct state. If the data needs to be coerced, this method will also return an instance of this ColorModel with the isAlphaPremultiplied flag set appropriately. This method will throw a UnsupportedOperationException if it is not supported by this ColorModel. Since ColorModel is an abstract class, any instance is an instance of a subclass. Subclasses must override this method since the implementation in this abstract class throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

					publicWritableRaster많etAlphaRaster(WritableRasterraster)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Raster representing the alpha channel of an image, extracted from the input Raster, provided that pixel values of this ColorModel represent color and alpha information as separate spatial bands (e.g. ComponentColorModel and DirectColorModel). This method assumes that Raster objects associated with such a ColorModel store the alpha band, if present, as the last band of image data. Returns null if there is no separate spatial alpha channel associated with this ColorModel. If this is an IndexColorModel which has alpha in the lookup table, this method will return null since there is no spatially discrete alpha channel. This method will create a new Raster (but will share the data array). Since ColorModel is an abstract class, any instance is an instance of a subclass. Subclasses must override this method to get any behavior other than returning null because the implementation in this abstract class returns null.
