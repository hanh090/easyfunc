		</name>
		<description>
			The metal look and feel implementation of TreeUI. MetalTreeUI allows for configuring how to visually render the spacing and delineation between nodes. The following hints are supported: Angled A line is drawn connecting the child to the parent. For handling of the root node refer to JTree.setRootVisible(boolean) and JTree.setShowsRootHandles(boolean). Horizontal A horizontal line is drawn dividing the children of the root node. None Do not draw any visual indication between nodes. As it is typically impratical to obtain the TreeUI from the JTree and cast to an instance of MetalTreeUI you enable this property via the client property JTree.lineStyle. For example, to switch to Horizontal style you would do: tree.putClientProperty("JTree.lineStyle", "Horizontal"); The default is Angled.

					Description copied from class:BasicTreeUI The horizontal element of legs between nodes starts at the right of the left-hand side of the child node by default. This method makes the leg end before that.

				<description>
					Description copied from class:ComponentUI Configures the specified component appropriately for the look and feel. This method is invoked when the ComponentUI instance is being installed as the UI delegate on the specified component. This method should completely configure the component for the look and feel, including the following: Install default property values for color, fonts, borders, icons, opacity, etc. on the component. Whenever possible, property values initialized by the client program should not be overridden. Install a LayoutManager on the component if necessary. Create/add any required sub-components to the component. Create/install event listeners on the component. Create/install a PropertyChangeListener on the component in order to detect and respond to component property changes appropriately. Install keyboard UI (mnemonics, traversal, etc.) on the component. Initialize any appropriate instance data.

				<description>
					Description copied from class:ComponentUI Reverses configuration which was done on the specified component during installUI. This method is invoked when this UIComponent instance is being removed as the UI delegate for the specified component. This method should undo the configuration performed in installUI, being careful to leave the JComponent instance in a clean state (no extraneous listeners, look-and-feel-specific property objects, etc.). This should include the following: Remove any UI-set borders from the component. Remove any UI-set layout managers on the component. Remove any UI-added sub-components from the component. Remove any UI-added event/property listeners from the component. Remove any UI-installed keyboard UI from the component. Nullify any allocated instance data objects to allow for GC.
