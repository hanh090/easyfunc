			public interface Referenceable

		<description>
			This interface is implemented by an object that can provide a Reference to itself. A Reference represents a way of recording address information about objects which themselves are not directly bound to the naming system. Such objects can implement the Referenceable interface as a way for programs that use that object to determine what its Reference is. For example, when binding a object, if an object implements the Referenceable interface, getReference() can be invoked on the object to get its Reference to use for binding.
