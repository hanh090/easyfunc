		<description>
			Class JobImpressionsCompleted is an integer valued printing attribute class that specifies the number of impressions completed for the job so far. For printing devices, the impressions completed includes interpreting, marking, and stacking the output. The JobImpressionsCompleted attribute describes the progress of the job. This attribute is intended to be a counter. That is, the JobImpressionsCompleted value for a job that has not started processing must be 0. When the job's JobState is PROCESSING or PROCESSING_STOPPED, the JobImpressionsCompleted value is intended to increase as the job is processed; it indicates the amount of the job that has been processed at the time the Print Job's attribute set is queried or at the time a print job event is reported. When the job enters the COMPLETED, CANCELED, or ABORTED states, the JobImpressionsCompleted value is the final value for the job. IPP Compatibility: The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
