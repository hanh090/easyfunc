		<description>
			Class JobPrioritySupported is an integer valued printing attribute class that specifies whether a Print Service instance supports the JobPriority attribute and the number of different job priority levels supported. The client can always specify any JobPriority value from 1 to 100 for a job. However, the Print Service instance may support fewer than 100 different job priority levels. If this is the case, the Print Service instance automatically maps the client-specified job priority value to one of the supported job priority levels, dividing the 100 job priority values equally among the available job priority levels. IPP Compatibility: The integer value gives the IPP integer value. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
