		<description>
			A Sequence is a data structure containing musical information (often an entire song or composition) that can be played back by a Sequencer object. Specifically, the Sequence contains timing information and one or more tracks. Each track consists of a series of MIDI events (such as note-ons, note-offs, program changes, and meta-events). The sequence's timing information specifies the type of unit that is used to time-stamp the events in the sequence. A Sequence can be created from a MIDI file by reading the file into an input stream and invoking one of the getSequence methods of MidiSystem. A sequence can also be built from scratch by adding new Tracks to an empty Sequence, and adding MidiEvent objects to these Tracks.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicSequence(float맋ivisionType,          intresolution)           throws InvalidMidiDataException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new MIDI sequence with the specified timing division type and timing resolution. The division type must be one of the recognized MIDI timing types. For tempo-based timing, divisionType is PPQ (pulses per quarter note) and the resolution is specified in ticks per beat. For SMTPE timing, divisionType specifies the number of frames per second and the resolution is specified in ticks per frame. The sequence will contain no initial tracks. Tracks may be added to or removed from the sequence using createTrack() and deleteTrack(javax.sound.midi.Track).

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new MIDI sequence with the specified timing division type, timing resolution, and number of tracks. The division type must be one of the recognized MIDI timing types. For tempo-based timing, divisionType is PPQ (pulses per quarter note) and the resolution is specified in ticks per beat. For SMTPE timing, divisionType specifies the number of frames per second and the resolution is specified in ticks per frame. The sequence will be initialized with the number of tracks specified by numTracks. These tracks are initially empty (i.e. they contain only the meta-event End of Track). The tracks may be retrieved for editing using the getTracks() method. Additional tracks may be added, or existing tracks removed, using createTrack() and deleteTrack(javax.sound.midi.Track).

			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etResolution()
