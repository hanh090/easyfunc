		</name>
		<description>
			The GeneralPath class represents a geometric path constructed from straight lines, and quadratic and cubic (Bézier) curves. It can contain multiple subpaths. GeneralPath is a legacy final class which exactly implements the behavior of its superclass Path2D.Float. Together with Path2D.Double, the Path2D classes provide full implementations of a general geometric path that support all of the functionality of the Shape and PathIterator interfaces with the ability to explicitly select different levels of internal coordinate precision. Use Path2D.Float (or this legacy GeneralPath subclass) when dealing with data that can be represented and used with floating point precision. Use Path2D.Double for data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public GeneralPath()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new empty single precision GeneralPath object with a default winding rule of Path2D.WIND_NON_ZERO.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public GeneralPath(int rule)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new GeneralPath object with the specified winding rule to control operations that require the interior of the path to be defined.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public GeneralPath(int rule,             int initialCapacity)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new GeneralPath object with the specified winding rule and the specified initial capacity to store path coordinates. This number is an initial guess as to how many path segments will be added to the path, but the storage is expanded as needed to store whatever path segments are added.

			<method>
				<name>
					public GeneralPath(Shape s)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new GeneralPath object from an arbitrary Shape object. All of the initial geometry and the winding rule for this path are taken from the specified Shape object.
