			public class DefaultKeyboardFocusManager  extends KeyboardFocusManager
		</name>
		<description>
			The default KeyboardFocusManager for AWT applications. Focus traversal is done in response to a Component's focus traversal keys, and using a Container's FocusTraversalPolicy. Please see How to Use the Focus Subsystem, a section in The Java Tutorial, and the Focus Specification for more information.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean맋ispatchEvent(AWTEvent만)
				</name>
				<description>
					This method is called by the AWT event dispatcher requesting that the current KeyboardFocusManager dispatch the specified event on its behalf. DefaultKeyboardFocusManagers dispatch all FocusEvents, all WindowEvents related to focus, and all KeyEvents. These events are dispatched based on the KeyboardFocusManager's notion of the focus owner and the focused and active Windows, sometimes overriding the source of the specified AWTEvent. If this method returns false, then the AWT event dispatcher will attempt to dispatch the event itself.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean맋ispatchKeyEvent(KeyEvent만)
				</name>
				<description>
					Called by dispatchEvent if no other KeyEventDispatcher in the dispatcher chain dispatched the KeyEvent, or if no other KeyEventDispatchers are registered. If the event has not been consumed, its target is enabled, and the focus owner is not null, this method dispatches the event to its target. This method will also subsequently dispatch the event to all registered KeyEventPostProcessors. After all this operations are finished, the event is passed to peers for processing. In all cases, this method returns true, since DefaultKeyboardFocusManager is designed so that neither dispatchEvent, nor the AWT event dispatcher, should take further action on the event in any situation.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean맗ostProcessKeyEvent(KeyEvent만)
				</name>
				<description>
					This method will be called by dispatchKeyEvent. It will handle any unconsumed KeyEvents that map to an AWT MenuShortcut by consuming the event and activating the shortcut.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맗rocessKeyEvent(Component맍ocusedComponent,                     KeyEvent만)
				</name>
				<description>
					This method initiates a focus traversal operation if and only if the KeyEvent represents a focus traversal key for the specified focusedComponent. It is expected that focusedComponent is the current focus owner, although this need not be the case. If it is not, focus traversal will nevertheless proceed as if focusedComponent were the focus owner.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected맜oid만nqueueKeyEvents(long마fter,                      Component맛ntilFocused)
				</name>
				<description>
					Delays dispatching of KeyEvents until the specified Component becomes the focus owner. KeyEvents with timestamps later than the specified timestamp will be enqueued until the specified Component receives a FOCUS_GAINED event, or the AWT cancels the delay request by invoking dequeueKeyEvents or discardKeyEvents.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected맜oid맋equeueKeyEvents(long마fter,                      Component맛ntilFocused)
				</name>
				<description>
					Releases for normal dispatching to the current focus owner all KeyEvents which were enqueued because of a call to enqueueKeyEvents with the same timestamp and Component. If the given timestamp is less than zero, the outstanding enqueue request for the given Component with the oldest timestamp (if any) should be cancelled.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					protected맜oid맋iscardKeyEvents(Component맊omp)
				</name>
				<description>
					Discards all KeyEvents which were enqueued because of one or more calls to enqueueKeyEvents with the specified Component, or one of its descendants.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맍ocusPreviousComponent(Component마Component)
				</name>
				<description>
					Focuses the Component before aComponent, typically based on a FocusTraversalPolicy.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맍ocusNextComponent(Component마Component)
				</name>
				<description>
					Focuses the Component after aComponent, typically based on a FocusTraversalPolicy.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맛pFocusCycle(Component마Component)
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the focus up one focus traversal cycle. Typically, the focus owner is set to aComponent's focus cycle root, and the current focus cycle root is set to the new focus owner's focus cycle root. If, however, aComponent's focus cycle root is a Window, then the focus owner is set to the focus cycle root's default Component to focus, and the current focus cycle root is unchanged.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맋ownFocusCycle(Container마Container)
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the focus down one focus traversal cycle. If aContainer is a focus cycle root, then the focus owner is set to aContainer's default Component to focus, and the current focus cycle root is set to aContainer. If aContainer is not a focus cycle root, then no focus traversal operation occurs.
