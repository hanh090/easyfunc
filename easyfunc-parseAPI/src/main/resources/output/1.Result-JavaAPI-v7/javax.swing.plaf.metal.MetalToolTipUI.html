			A Metal L&F extension of BasicToolTipUI. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

					Description copied from class:ComponentUI Configures the specified component appropriately for the look and feel. This method is invoked when the ComponentUI instance is being installed as the UI delegate on the specified component. This method should completely configure the component for the look and feel, including the following: Install default property values for color, fonts, borders, icons, opacity, etc. on the component. Whenever possible, property values initialized by the client program should not be overridden. Install a LayoutManager on the component if necessary. Create/add any required sub-components to the component. Create/install event listeners on the component. Create/install a PropertyChangeListener on the component in order to detect and respond to component property changes appropriately. Install keyboard UI (mnemonics, traversal, etc.) on the component. Initialize any appropriate instance data.

					Description copied from class:ComponentUI Reverses configuration which was done on the specified component during installUI. This method is invoked when this UIComponent instance is being removed as the UI delegate for the specified component. This method should undo the configuration performed in installUI, being careful to leave the JComponent instance in a clean state (no extraneous listeners, look-and-feel-specific property objects, etc.). This should include the following: Remove any UI-set borders from the component. Remove any UI-set layout managers on the component. Remove any UI-added sub-components from the component. Remove any UI-added event/property listeners from the component. Remove any UI-installed keyboard UI from the component. Nullify any allocated instance data objects to allow for GC.

					Description copied from class:ComponentUI Paints the specified component appropriately for the look and feel. This method is invoked from the ComponentUI.update method when the specified component is being painted. Subclasses should override this method and use the specified Graphics object to render the content of the component.

				<description>
					Description copied from class:ComponentUI Returns the specified component's preferred size appropriate for the look and feel. If null is returned, the preferred size will be calculated by the component's layout manager instead (this is the preferred approach for any component with a specific layout manager installed). The default implementation of this method returns null.
