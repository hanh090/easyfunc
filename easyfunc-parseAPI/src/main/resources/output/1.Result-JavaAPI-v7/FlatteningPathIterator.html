			public class FlatteningPathIterator  extends Object  implements PathIterator
		</name>
		<description>
			The FlatteningPathIterator class returns a flattened view of another PathIterator object. Other Shape classes can use this class to provide flattening behavior for their paths without having to perform the interpolation calculations themselves.

				<name>
					publicFlatteningPathIterator(PathIterator맙rc,                        double맍latness)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new FlatteningPathIterator object that flattens a path as it iterates over it. The iterator does not subdivide any curve read from the source iterator to more than 10 levels of subdivision which yields a maximum of 1024 line segments per curve.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new FlatteningPathIterator object that flattens a path as it iterates over it. The limit parameter allows you to control the maximum number of recursive subdivisions that the iterator can make before it assumes that the curve is flat enough without measuring against the flatness parameter. The flattened iteration therefore never generates more than a maximum of (2^limit) line segments per curve.

					Returns the flatness of this iterator.

				<description>
					Moves the iterator to the next segment of the path forwards along the primary direction of traversal as long as there are more points in that direction.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt맊urrentSegment(float[]맊oords)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the coordinates and type of the current path segment in the iteration. The return value is the path segment type: SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, or SEG_CLOSE. A float array of length 6 must be passed in and can be used to store the coordinates of the point(s). Each point is stored as a pair of float x,y coordinates. SEG_MOVETO and SEG_LINETO types return one point, and SEG_CLOSE does not return any points.

				<description>
					Returns the coordinates and type of the current path segment in the iteration. The return value is the path segment type: SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, or SEG_CLOSE. A double array of length 6 must be passed in and can be used to store the coordinates of the point(s). Each point is stored as a pair of double x,y coordinates. SEG_MOVETO and SEG_LINETO types return one point, and SEG_CLOSE does not return any points.
