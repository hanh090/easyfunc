		<description>
			A GlyphVector object is a collection of glyphs containing geometric information for the placement of each glyph in a transformed coordinate space which corresponds to the device on which the GlyphVector is ultimately displayed. The GlyphVector does not attempt any interpretation of the sequence of glyphs it contains. Relationships between adjacent glyphs in sequence are solely used to determine the placement of the glyphs in the visual coordinate space. Instances of GlyphVector are created by a Font. In a text processing application that can cache intermediate representations of text, creation and subsequent caching of a GlyphVector for use during rendering is the fastest method to present the visual representation of characters to a user. A GlyphVector is associated with exactly one Font, and can provide data useful only in relation to this Font. In addition, metrics obtained from a GlyphVector are not generally geometrically scaleable since the pixelization and spacing are dependent on grid-fitting algorithms within a Font. To facilitate accurate measurement of a GlyphVector and its component glyphs, you must specify a scaling transform, anti-alias mode, and fractional metrics mode when creating the GlyphVector. These characteristics can be derived from the destination device. For each glyph in the GlyphVector, you can obtain: the position of the glyph the transform associated with the glyph the metrics of the glyph in the context of the GlyphVector. The metrics of the glyph may be different under different transforms, application specified rendering hints, and the specific instance of the glyph within the GlyphVector. Altering the data used to create the GlyphVector does not alter the state of the GlyphVector. Methods are provided to adjust the positions of the glyphs within the GlyphVector. These methods are most appropriate for applications that are performing justification operations for the presentation of the glyphs. Methods are provided to transform individual glyphs within the GlyphVector. These methods are primarily useful for special effects. Methods are provided to return both the visual, logical, and pixel bounds of the entire GlyphVector or of individual glyphs within the GlyphVector. Methods are provided to return a Shape for the GlyphVector, and for individual glyphs within the GlyphVector.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the pixel bounds of this GlyphVector when rendered in a graphics with the given FontRenderContext at the given location. The renderFRC need not be the same as the FontRenderContext of this GlyphVector, and can be null. If it is null, the FontRenderContext of this GlyphVector is used. The default implementation returns the visual bounds, offset to x, y and rounded out to the next integer value (i.e. returns an integer rectangle which encloses the visual bounds) and ignores the FRC. Subclassers should override this method.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the transform of the specified glyph within this GlyphVector. The transform is relative to the glyph position. If no special transform has been applied, null can be returned. A null return indicates an identity transform.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the transform of the specified glyph within this GlyphVector. The transform is relative to the glyph position. A null argument for newTX indicates that no special transform is applied for the specified glyph. This method can be used to rotate, mirror, translate and scale the glyph. Adding a transform can result in signifant performance changes.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etLayoutFlags()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns flags describing the global state of the GlyphVector. Flags not described below are reserved. The default implementation returns 0 (meaning false) for the position adjustments, transforms, rtl, and complex flags. Subclassers should override this method, and make sure it correctly describes the GlyphVector and corresponds to the results of related calls.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract맍loat[]많etGlyphPositions(int막eginGlyphIndex,                          int맕umEntries,                          float[]맗ositionReturn)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of glyph positions for the specified glyphs. This method is used for convenience and performance when processing glyph positions. If no array is passed in, a new array is created. Even numbered array entries beginning with position zero are the X coordinates of the glyph numbered beginGlyphIndex + position/2. Odd numbered array entries beginning with position one are the Y coordinates of the glyph numbered beginGlyphIndex + (position-1)/2. If beginGlyphIndex equals the number of of glyphs in this GlyphVector, this method gets the position after the last glyph and this position is used to define the advance of the entire GlyphVector.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstractShape많etGlyphLogicalBounds(int많lyphIndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the logical bounds of the specified glyph within this GlyphVector. These logical bounds have a total of four edges, with two edges parallel to the baseline under the glyph's transform and the other two edges are shared with adjacent glyphs if they are present. This method is useful for hit-testing of the specified glyph, positioning of a caret at the leading or trailing edge of a glyph, and for drawing a highlight region around the specified glyph.
