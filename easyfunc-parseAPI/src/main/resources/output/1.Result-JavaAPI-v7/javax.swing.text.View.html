		<description>
			A very important part of the text package is the View class. As the name suggests it represents a view of the text model, or a piece of the text model. It is this class that is responsible for the look of the text component. The view is not intended to be some completely new thing that one must learn, but rather is much like a lightweight component. By default, a view is very light. It contains a reference to the parent view from which it can fetch many things without holding state, and it contains a reference to a portion of the model (Element). A view does not have to exactly represent an element in the model, that is simply a typical and therefore convenient mapping. A view can alternatively maintain a couple of Position objects to maintain its location in the model (i.e. represent a fragment of an element). This is typically the result of formatting where views have been broken down into pieces. The convenience of a substantial relationship to the element makes it easier to build factories to produce the views, and makes it easier to keep track of the view pieces as the model is changed and the view must be changed to reflect the model. Simple views therefore represent an Element directly and complex views do not. A view has the following responsibilities: Participate in layout. The view has a setSize method which is like doLayout and setSize in Component combined. The view has a preferenceChanged method which is like invalidate in Component except that one can invalidate just one axis and the child requesting the change is identified. A View expresses the size that it would like to be in terms of three values, a minimum, a preferred, and a maximum span. Layout in a view is can be done independently upon each axis. For a properly functioning View implementation, the minimum span will be <= the preferred span which in turn will be <= the maximum span. The minimum set of methods for layout are: getMinimumSpan getPreferredSpan getMaximumSpan getAlignment preferenceChanged setSize The setSize method should be prepared to be called a number of times (i.e. It may be called even if the size didn't change). The setSize method is generally called to make sure the View layout is complete prior to trying to perform an operation on it that requires an up-to-date layout. A view's size should always be set to a value within the minimum and maximum span specified by that view. Additionally, the view must always call the preferenceChanged method on the parent if it has changed the values for the layout it would like, and expects the parent to honor. The parent View is not required to recognize a change until the preferenceChanged has been sent. This allows parent View implementations to cache the child requirements if desired. The calling sequence looks something like the following: The exact calling sequence is up to the layout functionality of the parent view (if the view has any children). The view may collect the preferences of the children prior to determining what it will give each child, or it might iteratively update the children one at a time. Render a portion of the model. This is done in the paint method, which is pretty much like a component paint method. Views are expected to potentially populate a fairly large tree. A View has the following semantics for rendering: The view gets its allocation from the parent at paint time, so it must be prepared to redo layout if the allocated area is different from what it is prepared to deal with. The coordinate system is the same as the hosting Component (i.e. the Component returned by the getContainer method). This means a child view lives in the same coordinate system as the parent view unless the parent has explicitly changed the coordinate system. To schedule itself to be repainted a view can call repaint on the hosting Component. The default is to not clip the children. It is more efficient to allow a view to clip only if it really feels it needs clipping. The Graphics object given is not initialized in any way. A view should set any settings needed. A View is inherently transparent. While a view may render into its entire allocation, typically a view does not. Rendering is performed by tranversing down the tree of View implementations. Each View is responsible for rendering its children. This behavior is depended upon for thread safety. While view implementations do not necessarily have to be implemented with thread safety in mind, other view implementations that do make use of concurrency can depend upon a tree traversal to guarantee thread safety. The order of views relative to the model is up to the implementation. Although child views will typically be arranged in the same order that they occur in the model, they may be visually arranged in an entirely different order. View implementations may have Z-Order associated with them if the children are overlapping. The methods for rendering are: paint Translate between the model and view coordinate systems. Because the view objects are produced from a factory and therefore cannot necessarily be counted upon to be in a particular pattern, one must be able to perform translation to properly locate spatial representation of the model. The methods for doing this are: modelToView viewToModel getDocument getElement getStartOffset getEndOffset The layout must be valid prior to attempting to make the translation. The translation is not valid, and must not be attempted while changes are being broadcasted from the model via a DocumentEvent. Respond to changes from the model. If the overall view is represented by many pieces (which is the best situation if one want to be able to change the view and write the least amount of new code), it would be impractical to have a huge number of DocumentListeners. If each view listened to the model, only a few would actually be interested in the changes broadcasted at any given time. Since the model has no knowledge of views, it has no way to filter the broadcast of change information. The view hierarchy itself is instead responsible for propagating the change information. At any level in the view hierarchy, that view knows enough about its children to best distribute the change information further. Changes are therefore broadcasted starting from the root of the view hierarchy. The methods for doing this are: insertUpdate removeUpdate changedUpdate

				</name>
				<description>
					Establishes the parent view for this view. This is guaranteed to be called before any other methods if the parent view is functioning properly. This is also the last method called, since it is called to indicate the view has been removed from the hierarchy as well. When this method is called to set the parent to null, this method does the same for each of its children, propogating the notification that they have been disconnected from the view tree. If this is reimplemented, super.setParent() should be called.

				</name>
				<description>
					Replaces child views. If there are no views to remove this acts as an insert. If there are no views to add this acts as a remove. Views being removed will have the parent set to null, and the internal reference to them removed so that they can be garbage collected. This is implemented to do nothing, because by default a view has no children.

				<description>
					Gives notification that something was inserted into the document in a location that this view is responsible for. To reduce the burden to subclasses, this functionality is spread out into the following calls that subclasses can reimplement: updateChildren is called if there were any changes to the element this view is responsible for. If this view has child views that are represent the child elements, then this method should do whatever is necessary to make sure the child views correctly represent the model. forwardUpdate is called to forward the DocumentEvent to the appropriate child views. updateLayout is called to give the view a chance to either repair its layout, to reschedule layout, or do nothing.

					Fetches the model associated with the view.
				</description>

				<description>
					Fetches the structural portion of the subject that this view is mapped to. The view may not be responsible for the entire portion of the element.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Graphics getGraphics()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetch a Graphics for rendering. This can be used to determine font characteristics, and will be different for a print view than a component view.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public AttributeSet getAttributes()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches the attributes to use when rendering. By default this simply returns the attributes of the associated element. This method should be used rather than using the element directly to obtain access to the attributes to allow view-specific attributes to be mixed in or to allow the view to have view-specific conversion of attributes by subclasses. Each view should document what attributes it recognizes for the purpose of rendering or layout, and should always access them through the AttributeSet returned by this method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public View breakView(int axis,               int offset,               float pos,               float len)
				</name>
				<description>
					Tries to break this view on the given axis. This is called by views that try to do formatting of their children. For example, a view of a paragraph will typically try to place its children into row and views representing chunks of text can sometimes be broken down into smaller pieces. This is implemented to return the view itself, which represents the default behavior on not being breakable. If the view does support breaking, the starting offset of the view returned should be the given offset, and the end offset should be less than or equal to the end offset of the view being broken.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public View createFragment(int p0,                    int p1)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a view that represents a portion of the element. This is potentially useful during formatting operations for taking measurements of fragments of the view. If the view doesn't support fragmenting (the default), it should return itself.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getBreakWeight(int axis,                   float pos,                   float len)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines how attractive a break opportunity in this view is. This can be used for determining which view is the most attractive to call breakView on in the process of formatting. A view that represents text that has whitespace in it might be more attractive than a view that has no whitespace, for example. The higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A value equal to or lower than BadBreakWeight should not be considered for a break. A value greater than or equal to ForcedBreakWeight should be broken. This is implemented to provide the default behavior of returning BadBreakWeight unless the length is greater than the length of the view in which case the entire view represents the fragment. Unless a view has been written to support breaking behavior, it is not attractive to try and break the view. An example of a view that does support breaking is LabelView. An example of a view that uses break weight is ParagraphView.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Container getContainer()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches the container hosting the view. This is useful for things like scheduling a repaint, finding out the host components font, etc. The default implementation of this is to forward the query to the parent view.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ViewFactory getViewFactory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches the ViewFactory implementation that is feeding the view hierarchy. Normally the views are given this as an argument to updates from the model when they are most likely to need the factory, but this method serves to provide it at other times.

				</name>
				<description>
					Updates the child views in response to receiving notification that the model changed, and there is change record for the element this view is responsible for. This is implemented to assume the child views are directly responsible for the child elements of the element this view represents. The ViewFactory is used to create child views for each element specified as added in the ElementChange, starting at the index specified in the given ElementChange. The number of child views representing the removed elements specified are removed.

				</name>
				<description>
					Forwards the given DocumentEvent to the child views that need to be notified of the change to the model. If there were changes to the element this view is responsible for, that should be considered when forwarding (i.e. new child views should not get notified).
