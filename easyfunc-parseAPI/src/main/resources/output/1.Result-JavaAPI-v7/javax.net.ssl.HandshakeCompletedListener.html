			public interface HandshakeCompletedListener  extends EventListener
		</name>
		<description>
			This interface is implemented by any class which wants to receive notifications about the completion of an SSL protocol handshake on a given SSL connection. When an SSL handshake completes, new security parameters will have been established. Those parameters always include the security keys used to protect messages. They may also include parameters associated with a new session such as authenticated peer identity and a new SSL cipher suite.
