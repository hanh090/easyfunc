		<description>
			A DefaultMutableTreeNode is a general-purpose node in a tree data structure. For examples of using default mutable tree nodes, see How to Use Trees in The Java Tutorial. A tree node may have at most one parent and 0 or more children. DefaultMutableTreeNode provides operations for examining and modifying a node's parent and children and also operations for examining the tree that the node is a part of. A node's tree is the set of all nodes that can be reached by starting at the node and following all the possible links to parents and children. A node with no parent is the root of its tree; a node with no children is a leaf. A tree may consist of many subtrees, each node acting as the root for its own subtree. This class provides enumerations for efficiently traversing a tree or subtree in various orders or for following the path between two nodes. A DefaultMutableTreeNode may also hold a reference to a user object, the use of which is left to the user. Asking a DefaultMutableTreeNode for its string representation with toString() returns the string representation of its user object. This is not a thread safe class.If you intend to use a DefaultMutableTreeNode (or a tree of TreeNodes) in more than one thread, you need to do your own synchronizing. A good convention to adopt is synchronizing on the root node of a tree. While DefaultMutableTreeNode implements the MutableTreeNode interface and will allow you to add in any implementation of MutableTreeNode not all of the methods in DefaultMutableTreeNode will be applicable to all MutableTreeNodes implementations. Especially with some of the enumerations that are provided, using some of these methods assumes the DefaultMutableTreeNode contains only DefaultMutableNode instances. All of the TreeNode/MutableTreeNode methods will behave as defined no matter what implementations are added. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

					Returns true if this node is the root of the tree. The root is the only node in the tree with a null parent; every tree has exactly one root.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDefaultMutableTreeNode많etNextNode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the node that follows this node in a preorder traversal of this node's tree. Returns null if this node is the last node of the traversal. This is an inefficient way to traverse the entire tree; use an enumeration, instead.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDefaultMutableTreeNode많etPreviousNode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the node that precedes this node in a preorder traversal of this node's tree. Returns null if this node is the first node of the traversal -- the root of the tree. This is an inefficient way to traverse the entire tree; use an enumeration, instead.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicEnumeration맗reorderEnumeration()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in preorder. The first node returned by the enumeration's nextElement() method is this node. Modifying the tree by inserting, removing, or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicEnumeration맗ostorderEnumeration()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in postorder. The first node returned by the enumeration's nextElement() method is the leftmost leaf. This is the same as a depth-first traversal. Modifying the tree by inserting, removing, or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicEnumeration막readthFirstEnumeration()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in breadth-first order. The first node returned by the enumeration's nextElement() method is this node. Modifying the tree by inserting, removing, or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicEnumeration맋epthFirstEnumeration()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates and returns an enumeration that traverses the subtree rooted at this node in depth-first order. The first node returned by the enumeration's nextElement() method is the leftmost leaf. This is the same as a postorder traversal. Modifying the tree by inserting, removing, or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicEnumeration맗athFromAncestorEnumeration(TreeNode마ncestor)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates and returns an enumeration that follows the path from ancestor to this node. The enumeration's nextElement() method first returns ancestor, then the child of ancestor that is an ancestor of this node, and so on, and finally returns this node. Creation of the enumeration is O(m) where m is the number of nodes between this node and ancestor, inclusive. Each nextElement() message is O(1). Modifying the tree by inserting, removing, or moving a node invalidates any enumerations created before the modification.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sNodeChild(TreeNode마Node)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if aNode is a child of this node. If aNode is null, this method returns false.

					Returns this node's last child. If this node has no children, throws NoSuchElementException.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicTreeNode많etChildAfter(TreeNode마Child)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the child in this node's child array that immediately follows aChild, which must be a child of this node. If aChild is the last child, returns null. This method performs a linear search of this node's children for aChild and is O(n) where n is the number of children; to traverse the entire array of children, use an enumeration instead.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicTreeNode많etChildBefore(TreeNode마Child)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the child in this node's child array that immediately precedes aChild, which must be a child of this node. If aChild is the first child, returns null. This method performs a linear search of this node's children for aChild and is O(n) where n is the number of children.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sNodeSibling(TreeNode마notherNode)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if anotherNode is a sibling of (has the same parent as) this node. A node is its own sibling. If anotherNode is null, returns false.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etSiblingCount()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of siblings of this node. A node is its own sibling (if it has no parent or no siblings, this method returns 1).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDefaultMutableTreeNode많etNextSibling()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the next sibling of this node in the parent's children array. Returns null if this node has no parent or is the parent's last child. This method performs a linear search that is O(n) where n is the number of children; to traverse the entire array, use the parent's child enumeration instead.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDefaultMutableTreeNode많etPreviousSibling()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the previous sibling of this node in the parent's children array. Returns null if this node has no parent or is the parent's first child. This method performs a linear search that is O(n) where n is the number of children.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sLeaf()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this node has no children. To distinguish between nodes that have no children and nodes that cannot have children (e.g. to distinguish files from empty directories), use this method in conjunction with getAllowsChildren
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDefaultMutableTreeNode많etFirstLeaf()
				</name>
				<description>
					Finds and returns the first leaf that is a descendant of this node -- either this node or its first child's first leaf. Returns this node if it is a leaf.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDefaultMutableTreeNode많etLastLeaf()
				</name>
				<description>
					Finds and returns the last leaf that is a descendant of this node -- either this node or its last child's last leaf. Returns this node if it is a leaf.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDefaultMutableTreeNode많etNextLeaf()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the leaf after this node or null if this node is the last leaf in the tree. In this implementation of the MutableNode interface, this operation is very inefficient. In order to determine the next node, this method first performs a linear search in the parent's child-list in order to find the current node. That implementation makes the operation suitable for short traversals from a known position. But to traverse all of the leaves in the tree, you should use depthFirstEnumeration to enumerate the nodes in the tree and use isLeaf on each node to determine which are leaves.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicDefaultMutableTreeNode많etPreviousLeaf()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the leaf before this node or null if this node is the first leaf in the tree. In this implementation of the MutableNode interface, this operation is very inefficient. In order to determine the previous node, this method first performs a linear search in the parent's child-list in order to find the current node. That implementation makes the operation suitable for short traversals from a known position. But to traverse all of the leaves in the tree, you should use depthFirstEnumeration to enumerate the nodes in the tree and use isLeaf on each node to determine which are leaves.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etLeafCount()
				</name>

				<description>
					Returns the result of sending toString() to this node's user object, or the empty string if the node has no user object.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicObject맊lone()
