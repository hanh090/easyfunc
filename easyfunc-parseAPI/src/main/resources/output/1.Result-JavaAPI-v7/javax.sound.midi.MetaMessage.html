		<description>
			A MetaMessage is a MidiMessage that is not meaningful to synthesizers, but that can be stored in a MIDI file and interpreted by a sequencer program. (See the discussion in the MidiMessage class description.) The Standard MIDI Files specification defines various types of meta-events, such as sequence number, lyric, cue point, and set tempo. There are also meta-events for such information as lyrics, copyrights, tempo indications, time and key signatures, markers, etc. For more information, see the Standard MIDI Files 1.0 specification, which is part of the Complete MIDI 1.0 Detailed Specification published by the MIDI Manufacturer's Association (http://www.midi.org). When data is being transported using MIDI wire protocol, a ShortMessage with the status value 0xFF represents a system reset message. In MIDI files, this same status value denotes a MetaMessage. The types of meta-message are distinguished from each other by the first byte that follows the status byte 0xFF. The subsequent bytes are data bytes. As with system exclusive messages, there are an arbitrary number of data bytes, depending on the type of MetaMessage.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt META
				</name>
				<description>
					Status byte for MetaMessage (0xFF, or 255), which is used in MIDI files. It has the same value as SYSTEM_RESET, which is used in the real-time "MIDI wire" protocol.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicMetaMessage()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new MetaMessage. The contents of the message are not set here; use setMessage to set them subsequently.
				</description>

				<name>
					publicMetaMessage(int맚ype,             byte[]맋ata,             int맓ength)              throws InvalidMidiDataException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new MetaMessage and sets the message parameters. The contents of the message can be changed by using the setMessage method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protectedMetaMessage(byte[]맋ata)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new MetaMessage.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the message parameters for a MetaMessage. Since only one status byte value, 0xFF, is allowed for meta-messages, it does not need to be specified here. Calls to getStatus return 0xFF for all meta-messages. The type argument should be a valid value for the byte that follows the status byte in the MetaMessage. The data argument should contain all the subsequent bytes of the MetaMessage. In other words, the byte that specifies the type of MetaMessage is not considered a data byte.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etType()
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains the type of the MetaMessage.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막yte[]많etData()
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains a copy of the data for the meta message. The returned array of bytes does not include the status byte or the message length data. The length of the data for the meta message is the length of the array. Note that the length of the entire message includes the status byte and the meta message type byte, and therefore may be longer than the returned array.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicObject맊lone()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a new object of the same class and with the same contents as this object.
