			public final class Currency  extends Object  implements Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			Represents a currency. Currencies are identified by their ISO 4217 currency codes. Visit the ISO web site for more information, including a table of currency codes. The class is designed so that there's never more than one Currency instance for any given currency. Therefore, there's no public constructor. You obtain a Currency instance using the getInstance methods. Users can supersede the Java runtime currency data by creating a properties file named <JAVA_HOME>/lib/currency.properties. The contents of the properties file are key/value pairs of the ISO 3166 country codes and the ISO 4217 currency data respectively. The value part consists of three ISO 4217 values of a currency, i.e., an alphabetic code, a numeric code, and a minor unit. Those three ISO 4217 values are separated by commas. The lines which start with '#'s are considered comment lines. For example, #Sample currency properties JP=JPZ,999,0 will supersede the currency data for Japan.

The method returns null for territories that don't have a currency, such as Antarctica.
