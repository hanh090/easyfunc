			XPathExpression provides access to compiled XPath expressions. Evaluation of XPath Expressions. context If a request is made to evaluate the expression in the absence of a context item, an empty document node will be used for the context. For the purposes of evaluating XPath expressions, a DocumentFragment is treated like a Document node. variables If the expression contains a variable reference, its value will be found through the XPathVariableResolver. An XPathExpressionException is raised if the variable resolver is undefined or the resolver returns null for the variable. The value of a variable must be immutable through the course of any single evaluation. functions If the expression contains a function reference, the function will be found through the XPathFunctionResolver. An XPathExpressionException is raised if the function resolver is undefined or the function resolver returns null for the function. QNames QNames in the expression are resolved against the XPath namespace context. result This result of evaluating an expression is converted to an instance of the desired return type. Valid return types are defined in XPathConstants. Conversion to the return type follows XPath conversion rules. An XPath expression is not thread-safe and not reentrant. In other words, it is the application's responsibility to make sure that one XPathExpression object is not used from more than one thread at any given time, and while the evaluate method is invoked, applications may not recursively call the evaluate method.

					Object evaluate(Object item,                QName returnType)                  throws XPathExpressionException

				<description>
					Evaluate the compiled XPath expression in the specified context and return the result as the specified type. See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. If returnType is not one of the types defined in XPathConstants, then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If a null value is provided for item, an empty document will be used for the context. If returnType is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown.

					String evaluate(Object item)                  throws XPathExpressionException
				</name>
				<description>
					Evaluate the compiled XPath expression in the specified context and return the result as a String. This method calls evaluate(Object item, QName returnType) with a returnType of XPathConstants.STRING. See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. If a null value is provided for item, an empty document will be used for the context.

				</name>
				<description>
					Evaluate the compiled XPath expression in the context of the specified InputSource and return the result as the specified type. This method builds a data model for the InputSource and calls evaluate(Object item, QName returnType) on the resulting document object. See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. If returnType is not one of the types defined in XPathConstants, then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If source or returnType is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown.
