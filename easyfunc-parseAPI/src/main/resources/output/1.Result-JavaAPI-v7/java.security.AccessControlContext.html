		<description>
			An AccessControlContext is used to make system resource access decisions based on the context it encapsulates. More specifically, it encapsulates a context and has a single method, checkPermission, that is equivalent to the checkPermission method in the AccessController class, with one difference: The AccessControlContext checkPermission method makes access decisions based on the context it encapsulates, rather than that of the current execution thread. Thus, the purpose of AccessControlContext is for those situations where a security check that should be made within a given context actually needs to be done from within a different context (for example, from within a worker thread). An AccessControlContext is created by calling the AccessController.getContext method. The getContext method takes a "snapshot" of the current calling context, and places it in an AccessControlContext object, which it returns. A sample call is the following:      AccessControlContext acc = AccessController.getContext()   Code within a different context can subsequently call the checkPermission method on the previously-saved AccessControlContext object. A sample call is the following:      acc.checkPermission(permission)

				</name>
				<description>
					Create a new AccessControlContext with the given AccessControlContext and DomainCombiner. This constructor associates the provided DomainCombiner with the provided AccessControlContext.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맊heckPermission(Permission맗erm)                       throws AccessControlException
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether the access request indicated by the specified permission should be allowed or denied, based on the security policy currently in effect, and the context in this object. The request is allowed only if every ProtectionDomain in the context implies the permission. Otherwise the request is denied. This method quietly returns if the access request is permitted, or throws a suitable AccessControlException otherwise.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean만quals(Object맖bj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Checks two AccessControlContext objects for equality. Checks that obj is an AccessControlContext and has the same set of ProtectionDomains as this context.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt맏ashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the hash code value for this context. The hash code is computed by exclusive or-ing the hash code of all the protection domains in the context together.
