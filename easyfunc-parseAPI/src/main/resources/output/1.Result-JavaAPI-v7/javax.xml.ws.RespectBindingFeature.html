			This feature clarifies the use of the wsdl:binding in a JAX-WS runtime. This feature can be used during the creation of SEI proxy, and Dispatch instances on the client side and Endpoint instances on the server side. This feature cannot be used for Service instance creation on the client side. This feature is only useful with web services that have an associated WSDL. Enabling this feature requires that a JAX-WS implementation inspect the wsdl:binding for an endpoint at runtime to make sure that all wsdl:extensions that have the required attribute set to true are understood and are being used. The following describes the affects of this feature with respect to be enabled or disabled: ENABLED: In this Mode, a JAX-WS runtime MUST assure that all required wsdl:binding extensions(including policies) are either understood and used by the runtime, or explicitly disabled by the web service application. A web service can disable a particular extension if there is a corresponding WebServiceFeature or annotation. Similarly, a web service client can disable particular extension using the corresponding WebServiceFeature while creating a proxy or Dispatch instance. The runtime MUST also make sure that binding of SEI parameters/return values respect the wsdl:binding. With this feature enabled, if a required (wsdl:required="true") wsdl:binding extension is in the WSDL and it is not supported by a JAX-WS runtime and it has not been explicitly turned off by the web service developer, then that JAX-WS runtime MUST behave appropriately based on whether it is on the client or server: Client: runtime MUST throw a WebServiceException no sooner than when one of the methods above is invoked but no later than the first invocation of an endpoint operation. Server: throw a WebServiceException and the endpoint MUST fail to deploy DISABLED: In this Mode, an implementation may choose whether to inspect the wsdl:binding or not and to what degree the wsdl:binding will be inspected. For example, one implementation may choose to behave as if this feature is enabled, another implementation may only choose to verify the SEI's parameter/return type bindings.
