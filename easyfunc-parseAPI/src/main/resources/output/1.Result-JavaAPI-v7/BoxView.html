		<description>
			A view that arranges its children into a box shape by tiling its children along an axis. The box is somewhat like that found in TeX where there is alignment of the children, flexibility of the children is considered, etc. This is a building block that might be useful to represent things like a collection of lines, paragraphs, lists, columns, pages, etc. The axis along which the children are tiled is considered the major axis. The orthoginal axis is the minor axis. Layout for each axis is handled separately by the methods layoutMajorAxis and layoutMinorAxis. Subclasses can change the layout algorithm by reimplementing these methods. These methods will be called as necessary depending upon whether or not there is cached layout information and the cache is considered valid. These methods are typically called if the given size along the axis changes, or if layoutChanged is called to force an updated layout. The layoutChanged method invalidates cached layout information, if there is any. The requirements published to the parent view are calculated by the methods calculateMajorAxisRequirements and calculateMinorAxisRequirements. If the layout algorithm is changed, these methods will likely need to be reimplemented.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맙etAxis(int마xis)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the tile axis property. This is the axis along which the child views are tiled.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맓ayoutChanged(int마xis)
				</name>
				<description>
					Invalidates the layout along an axis. This happens automatically if the preferences have changed for any of the child views. In some cases the layout may need to be recalculated when the preferences have not changed. The layout can be marked as invalid by calling this method. The layout will be updated the next time the setSize method is called on this view (typically in paint).

				</name>
				<description>
					Determines in which direction the next view lays. Consider the View at index n. Typically the Views are layed out from left to right, so that the View to the EAST will be at index n + 1, and the View to the WEST will be at index n - 1. In certain situations, such as with bidirectional text, it is possible that the View to EAST is not at index n + 1, but rather at index n - 1, or that the View to the WEST is not at index n - 1, but index n + 1. In this case this method would return true, indicating the Views are layed out in descending order. Otherwise the method would return false indicating the Views are layed out in ascending order. If the receiver is laying its Views along the Y_AXIS, this will will return the value from invoking the same method on the View responsible for rendering position and bias. Otherwise this will return false.
