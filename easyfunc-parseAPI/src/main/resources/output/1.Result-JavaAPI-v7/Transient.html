			public final class TRANSIENT  extends SystemException
		</name>
		<description>
			Exception thrown when the ORB attempted to reach an object and failed. It is not an indication that an object does not exist. Instead, it simply means that no further determination of an object's status was possible because it could not be reached. This exception is raised if an attempt to establish a connection fails, for example, because the server or the implementation repository is down. It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status. It may also contain a string describing the exception.
