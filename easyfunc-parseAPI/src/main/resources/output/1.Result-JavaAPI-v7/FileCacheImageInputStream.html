		</name>
		<description>
			An implementation of ImageInputStream that gets its input from a regular InputStream. A file is used to cache previously read data.

					publicFileCacheImageInputStream(InputStream맙tream,                           File맊acheDir)                            throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a FileCacheImageInputStream that will read from a given InputStream. A temporary file is used as a cache. If cacheDiris non-null and is a directory, the file will be created there. If it is null, the system-dependent default temporary-file directory will be used (see the documentation for File.createTempFile for details).

			<method>

					public말ntread()           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:ImageInputStreamImpl Reads a single byte from the stream and returns it as an int between 0 and 255. If EOF is reached, -1 is returned. Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method. The subclass implementation should update the stream position before exiting. The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before the read occurs.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:ImageInputStreamImpl Reads up to len bytes from the stream, and stores them into b starting at index off. If no bytes can be read because the end of the stream has been reached, -1 is returned. The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before the read occurs. Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method. The subclass implementation should update the stream position before exiting.

			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sCached()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true since this ImageInputStream caches data in order to allow seeking backwards.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sCachedFile()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true since this ImageInputStream maintains a file cache.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sCachedMemory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns false since this ImageInputStream does not maintain a main memory cache.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맊lose()             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Closes this FileCacheImageInputStream, closing and removing the cache file. The source InputStream is not closed.

					protected맜oid맍inalize()                   throws Throwable
				</name>
				<description>
					Finalizes this object prior to garbage collection. The close method is called to close any open input source. This method should not be called from application code.
