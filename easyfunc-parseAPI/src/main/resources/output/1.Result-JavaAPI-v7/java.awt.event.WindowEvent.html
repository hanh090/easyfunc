		</name>
		<description>
			A low-level event that indicates that a window has changed its status. This low-level event is generated by a Window object when it is opened, closed, activated, deactivated, iconified, or deiconified, or when focus is transfered into or out of the Window. The event is passed to every WindowListener or WindowAdapter object which registered to receive such events using the window's addWindowListener method. (WindowAdapter objects implement the WindowListener interface.) Each such listener object gets this WindowEvent when the event occurs. An unspecified behavior will be caused if the id parameter of any particular WindowEvent instance is not in the range from WINDOW_FIRST to WINDOW_LAST.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_FIRST
				</name>
				<description>
					The first number in the range of ids used for window events.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_OPENED
				</name>
				<description>
					The window opened event. This event is delivered only the first time a window is made visible.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_CLOSING
				</name>
				<description>
					The "window is closing" event. This event is delivered when the user attempts to close the window from the window's system menu. If the program does not explicitly hide or dispose the window while processing this event, the window close operation will be cancelled.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_CLOSED
				</name>
				<description>
					The window closed event. This event is delivered after the window has been closed as the result of a call to dispose.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_ICONIFIED
				</name>
				<description>
					The window iconified event. This event is delivered when the window has been changed from a normal to a minimized state. For many platforms, a minimized window is displayed as the icon specified in the window's iconImage property.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_DEICONIFIED
				</name>
				<description>
					The window deiconified event type. This event is delivered when the window has been changed from a minimized to a normal state.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_ACTIVATED
				</name>
				<description>
					The window-activated event type. This event is delivered when the Window becomes the active Window. Only a Frame or a Dialog can be the active Window. The native windowing system may denote the active Window or its children with special decorations, such as a highlighted title bar. The active Window is always either the focused Window, or the first Frame or Dialog that is an owner of the focused Window.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_DEACTIVATED
				</name>
				<description>
					The window-deactivated event type. This event is delivered when the Window is no longer the active Window. Only a Frame or a Dialog can be the active Window. The native windowing system may denote the active Window or its children with special decorations, such as a highlighted title bar. The active Window is always either the focused Window, or the first Frame or Dialog that is an owner of the focused Window.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS
				</name>
				<description>
					The window-gained-focus event type. This event is delivered when the Window becomes the focused Window, which means that the Window, or one of its subcomponents, will receive keyboard events.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS
				</name>
				<description>
					The window-lost-focus event type. This event is delivered when a Window is no longer the focused Window, which means keyboard events will no longer be delivered to the Window or any of its subcomponents.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED
				</name>
				<description>
					The window-state-changed event type. This event is delivered when a Window's state is changed by virtue of it being iconified, maximized etc.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final말nt WINDOW_LAST
				</name>
				<description>
					The last number in the range of ids used for window events.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicWindowEvent(Window맙ource,             int말d,             Window맖pposite,             int맖ldState,             int맕ewState)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a WindowEvent object. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null.

			<method>
				<name>
					publicWindowEvent(Window맙ource,             int말d,             Window맖pposite)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a WindowEvent object with the specified opposite Window. The opposite Window is the other Window involved in this focus or activation change. For a WINDOW_ACTIVATED or WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS event, this is the Window that lost activation or focus. For a WINDOW_DEACTIVATED or WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS event, this is the Window that gained activation or focus. If this focus change occurs with a native application, with a Java application in a different VM, or with no other Window, then the opposite Window is null. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a WindowEvent object with the specified previous and new window states. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicWindowEvent(Window맙ource,             int말d)

			<method>
				<name>
					publicWindow많etWindow()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the originator of the event.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicWindow많etOppositeWindow()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the other Window involved in this focus or activation change. For a WINDOW_ACTIVATED or WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS event, this is the Window that lost activation or focus. For a WINDOW_DEACTIVATED or WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS event, this is the Window that gained activation or focus. For any other type of WindowEvent, or if the focus or activation change occurs with a native application, with a Java application in a different VM or context, or with no other Window, null is returned.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etOldState()
				</name>
				<description>
					For WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED events returns the previous state of the window. The state is represented as a bitwise mask. NORMAL Indicates that no state bits are set. ICONIFIED MAXIMIZED_HORIZ MAXIMIZED_VERT MAXIMIZED_BOTH Concatenates MAXIMIZED_HORIZ and MAXIMIZED_VERT.

					public말nt많etNewState()
				</name>
				<description>
