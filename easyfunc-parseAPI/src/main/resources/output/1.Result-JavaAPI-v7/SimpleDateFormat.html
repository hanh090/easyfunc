		<description>
			SimpleDateFormat is a concrete class for formatting and parsing dates in a locale-sensitive manner. It allows for formatting (date -> text), parsing (text -> date), and normalization. SimpleDateFormat allows you to start by choosing any user-defined patterns for date-time formatting. However, you are encouraged to create a date-time formatter with either getTimeInstance, getDateInstance, or getDateTimeInstance in DateFormat. Each of these class methods can return a date/time formatter initialized with a default format pattern. You may modify the format pattern using the applyPattern methods as desired. For more information on using these methods, see DateFormat. Date and Time Patterns Date and time formats are specified by date and time pattern strings. Within date and time pattern strings, unquoted letters from 'A' to 'Z' and from 'a' to 'z' are interpreted as pattern letters representing the components of a date or time string. Text can be quoted using single quotes (') to avoid interpretation. "''" represents a single quote. All other characters are not interpreted; they're simply copied into the output string during formatting or matched against the input string during parsing. The following pattern letters are defined (all other characters from 'A' to 'Z' and from 'a' to 'z' are reserved): Letter Date or Time Component Presentation Examples G Era designator Text AD y Year Year 1996; 96 Y Week year Year 2009; 09 M Month in year Month July; Jul; 07 w Week in year Number 27 W Week in month Number 2 D Day in year Number 189 d Day in month Number 10 F Day of week in month Number 2 E Day name in week Text Tuesday; Tue u Day number of week (1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday) Number 1 a Am/pm marker Text PM H Hour in day (0-23) Number 0 k Hour in day (1-24) Number 24 K Hour in am/pm (0-11) Number 0 h Hour in am/pm (1-12) Number 12 m Minute in hour Number 30 s Second in minute Number 55 S Millisecond Number 978 z Time zone General time zone Pacific Standard Time; PST; GMT-08:00 Z Time zone RFC 822 time zone -0800 X Time zone ISO 8601 time zone -08; -0800; -08:00 Pattern letters are usually repeated, as their number determines the exact presentation: Text: For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more, the full form is used; otherwise a short or abbreviated form is used if available. For parsing, both forms are accepted, independent of the number of pattern letters. Number: For formatting, the number of pattern letters is the minimum number of digits, and shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount. For parsing, the number of pattern letters is ignored unless it's needed to separate two adjacent fields. Year: If the formatter's Calendar is the Gregorian calendar, the following rules are applied. For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 2, the year is truncated to 2 digits; otherwise it is interpreted as a number. For parsing, if the number of pattern letters is more than 2, the year is interpreted literally, regardless of the number of digits. So using the pattern "MM/dd/yyyy", "01/11/12" parses to Jan 11, 12 A.D. For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern ("y" or "yy"), SimpleDateFormat must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the SimpleDateFormat instance is created. For example, using a pattern of "MM/dd/yy" and a SimpleDateFormat instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string "01/11/12" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string "05/04/64" would be interpreted as May 4, 1964. During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by Character.isDigit(char), will be parsed into the default century. Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit string, or a two digit string that isn't all digits (for example, "-1"), is interpreted literally. So "01/02/3" or "01/02/003" are parsed, using the same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD. Likewise, "01/02/-3" is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC. Otherwise, calendar system specific forms are applied. For both formatting and parsing, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more, a calendar specific long form is used. Otherwise, a calendar specific short or abbreviated form is used. If week year 'Y' is specified and the calendar doesn't support any week years, the calendar year ('y') is used instead. The support of week years can be tested with a call to getCalendar().isWeekDateSupported(). Month: If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is interpreted as text; otherwise, it is interpreted as a number. General time zone: Time zones are interpreted as text if they have names. For time zones representing a GMT offset value, the following syntax is used:        GMTOffsetTimeZone:               GMT Sign Hours : Minutes       Sign: one of               + -       Hours:               Digit               Digit Digit       Minutes:               Digit Digit       Digit: one of               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Hours must be between 0 and 23, and Minutes must be between 00 and 59. The format is locale independent and digits must be taken from the Basic Latin block of the Unicode standard. For parsing, RFC 822 time zones are also accepted. RFC 822 time zone: For formatting, the RFC 822 4-digit time zone format is used:        RFC822TimeZone:               Sign TwoDigitHours Minutes       TwoDigitHours:               Digit Digit TwoDigitHours must be between 00 and 23. Other definitions are as for general time zones. For parsing, general time zones are also accepted. ISO 8601 Time zone: The number of pattern letters designates the format for both formatting and parsing as follows:        ISO8601TimeZone:               OneLetterISO8601TimeZone               TwoLetterISO8601TimeZone               ThreeLetterISO8601TimeZone       OneLetterISO8601TimeZone:               Sign TwoDigitHours               Z       TwoLetterISO8601TimeZone:               Sign TwoDigitHours Minutes               Z       ThreeLetterISO8601TimeZone:               Sign TwoDigitHours : Minutes               Z Other definitions are as for general time zones or RFC 822 time zones. For formatting, if the offset value from GMT is 0, "Z" is produced. If the number of pattern letters is 1, any fraction of an hour is ignored. For example, if the pattern is "X" and the time zone is "GMT+05:30", "+05" is produced. For parsing, "Z" is parsed as the UTC time zone designator. General time zones are not accepted. If the number of pattern letters is 4 or more, IllegalArgumentException is thrown when constructing a SimpleDateFormat or applying a pattern. SimpleDateFormat also supports localized date and time pattern strings. In these strings, the pattern letters described above may be replaced with other, locale dependent, pattern letters. SimpleDateFormat does not deal with the localization of text other than the pattern letters; that's up to the client of the class. Examples The following examples show how date and time patterns are interpreted in the U.S. locale. The given date and time are 2001-07-04 12:08:56 local time in the U.S. Pacific Time time zone. Date and Time Pattern Result "yyyy.MM.dd G 'at' HH:mm:ss z" 2001.07.04 AD at 12:08:56 PDT "EEE, MMM d, ''yy" Wed, Jul 4, '01 "h:mm a" 12:08 PM "hh 'o''clock' a, zzzz" 12 o'clock PM, Pacific Daylight Time "K:mm a, z" 0:08 PM, PDT "yyyyy.MMMMM.dd GGG hh:mm aaa" 02001.July.04 AD 12:08 PM "EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z" Wed, 4 Jul 2001 12:08:56 -0700 "yyMMddHHmmssZ" 010704120856-0700 "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ" 2001-07-04T12:08:56.235-0700 "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX" 2001-07-04T12:08:56.235-07:00 "YYYY-'W'ww-u" 2001-W27-3 Synchronization Date formats are not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread. If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized externally.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Date parse(String text,           ParsePosition pos)
				</name>
				<description>
					Parses text from a string to produce a Date. The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by pos. If parsing succeeds, then the index of pos is updated to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed date is returned. The updated pos can be used to indicate the starting point for the next call to this method. If an error occurs, then the index of pos is not changed, the error index of pos is set to the index of the character where the error occurred, and null is returned. This parsing operation uses the calendar to produce a Date. All of the calendar's date-time fields are cleared before parsing, and the calendar's default values of the date-time fields are used for any missing date-time information. For example, the year value of the parsed Date is 1970 with GregorianCalendar if no year value is given from the parsing operation. The TimeZone value may be overwritten, depending on the given pattern and the time zone value in text. Any TimeZone value that has previously been set by a call to setTimeZone may need to be restored for further operations.
