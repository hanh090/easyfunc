		<description>
			Mouse input, and focus handling for JList. An instance of this class is added to the appropriate java.awt.Component lists at installUI() time. Note keyboard input is handled with JComponent KeyboardActions, see installKeyboardActions(). Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface:MouseMotionListener Invoked when a mouse button is pressed on a component and then dragged. MOUSE_DRAGGED events will continue to be delivered to the component where the drag originated until the mouse button is released (regardless of whether the mouse position is within the bounds of the component). Due to platform-dependent Drag&Drop implementations, MOUSE_DRAGGED events may not be delivered during a native Drag&Drop operation.
