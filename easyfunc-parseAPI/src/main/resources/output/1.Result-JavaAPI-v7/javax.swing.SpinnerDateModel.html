		<description>
			A SpinnerModel for sequences of Dates. The upper and lower bounds of the sequence are defined by properties called start and end and the size of the increase or decrease computed by the nextValue and previousValue methods is defined by a property called calendarField. The start and end properties can be null to indicate that the sequence has no lower or upper limit. The value of the calendarField property must be one of the java.util.Calendar constants that specify a field within a Calendar. The getNextValue and getPreviousValue methods change the date forward or backwards by this amount. For example, if calendarField is Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, then nextValue produces a Date that's 24 hours after the current value, and previousValue produces a Date that's 24 hours earlier. The legal values for calendarField are: Calendar.ERA Calendar.YEAR Calendar.MONTH Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH Calendar.AM_PM Calendar.HOUR Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY Calendar.MINUTE Calendar.SECOND Calendar.MILLISECOND However some UIs may set the calendarField before commiting the edit to spin the field under the cursor. If you only want one field to spin you can subclass and ignore the setCalendarField calls. This model inherits a ChangeListener. The ChangeListeners are notified whenever the models value, calendarField, start, or end properties changes.

			<method>
				<name>
					public SpinnerDateModel(Date value,                  Comparable start,                  Comparable end,                  int calendarField)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a SpinnerDateModel that represents a sequence of dates between start and end. The nextValue and previousValue methods compute elements of the sequence by advancing or reversing the current date value by the calendarField time unit. For a precise description of what it means to increment or decrement a Calendar field, see the add method in java.util.Calendar. The start and end parameters can be null to indicate that the range doesn't have an upper or lower bound. If value or calendarField is null, or if both start and end are specified and mininum > maximum then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. Similarly if (minimum <= value <= maximum) is false, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

			<method>
				<name>
					public SpinnerDateModel()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a SpinnerDateModel whose initial value is the current date, calendarField is equal to Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, and for which there are no start/end limits.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setStart(Comparable start)
				</name>
				<description>
					Changes the lower limit for Dates in this sequence. If start is null, then there is no lower limit. No bounds checking is done here: the new start value may invalidate the (start <= value <= end) invariant enforced by the constructors. This is to simplify updating the model. Naturally one should ensure that the invariant is true before calling the nextValue, previousValue, or setValue methods. Typically this property is a Date however it's possible to use a Comparable with a compareTo method for Dates. For example start might be an instance of a class like this:    MyStartDate implements Comparable {       long t = 12345;       public int compareTo(Date d) {              return (t < d.getTime() ? -1 : (t == d.getTime() ? 0 : 1));       }       public int compareTo(Object o) {              return compareTo((Date)o);       }   }   Note that the above example will throw a ClassCastException if the Object passed to compareTo(Object) is not a Date. This method fires a ChangeEvent if the start has changed.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Comparable getStart()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the first Date in the sequence.

					public void setEnd(Comparable end)
				</name>
				<description>
					Changes the upper limit for Dates in this sequence. If start is null, then there is no upper limit. No bounds checking is done here: the new start value may invalidate the (start <= value <= end) invariant enforced by the constructors. This is to simplify updating the model. Naturally, one should ensure that the invariant is true before calling the nextValue, previousValue, or setValue methods. Typically this property is a Date however it's possible to use Comparable with a compareTo method for Dates. See setStart for an example. This method fires a ChangeEvent if the end has changed.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Comparable getEnd()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the last Date in the sequence.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setCalendarField(int calendarField)
				</name>
				<description>
					Changes the size of the date value change computed by the nextValue and previousValue methods. The calendarField parameter must be one of the Calendar field constants like Calendar.MONTH or Calendar.MINUTE. The nextValue and previousValue methods simply move the specified Calendar field forward or backward by one unit with the Calendar.add method. You should use this method with care as some UIs may set the calendarField before commiting the edit to spin the field under the cursor. If you only want one field to spin you can subclass and ignore the setCalendarField calls.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getCalendarField()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the Calendar field that is added to or subtracted from by the nextValue and previousValue methods.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object getNextValue()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the next Date in the sequence, or null if the next date is after end.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object getPreviousValue()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the previous Date in the sequence, or null if the previous date is before start.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Date getDate()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the current element in this sequence of Dates. This method is equivalent to (Date)getValue.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object getValue()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the current element in this sequence of Dates.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setValue(Object value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the current Date for this sequence. If value is null, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. No bounds checking is done here: the new value may invalidate the (start <= value < end) invariant enforced by the constructors. Naturally, one should ensure that the (start <= value <= maximum) invariant is true before calling the nextValue, previousValue, or setValue methods. This method fires a ChangeEvent if the value has changed.
