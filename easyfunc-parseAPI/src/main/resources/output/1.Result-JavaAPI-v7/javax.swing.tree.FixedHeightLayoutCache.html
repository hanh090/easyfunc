			NOTE: This will become more open in a future release. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

					public맜oid맙etRowHeight(introwHeight)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the height of each cell. If rowHeight is less than or equal to 0 this will throw an IllegalArgumentException.

			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etRowCount()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of visible rows.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid말nvalidatePathBounds(TreePath맗ath)
				</name>
				<description>
					Does nothing, FixedHeightLayoutCache doesn't cache width, and that is all that could change.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid말nvalidateSizes()
				</name>
				<description>
					Informs the TreeState that it needs to recalculate all the sizes it is referencing.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean말sExpanded(TreePath맗ath)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the value identified by row is currently expanded.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					publicRectangle많etBounds(TreePath맗ath,                    Rectangle맗laceIn)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a rectangle giving the bounds needed to draw path.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicTreePath많etPathForRow(introw)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the path for passed in row. If row is not visible null is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etRowForPath(TreePath맗ath)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the row that the last item identified in path is visible at. Will return -1 if any of the elements in path are not currently visible.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicTreePath많etPathClosestTo(int맞,                          int맟)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the path to the node that is closest to x,y. If there is nothing currently visible this will return null, otherwise it'll always return a valid path. If you need to test if the returned object is exactly at x, y you should get the bounds for the returned path and test x, y against that.

			<method>
				<name>
					public말nt많etVisibleChildCount(TreePath맗ath)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of visible children for row.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicEnumeration<TreePath>많etVisiblePathsFrom(TreePath맗ath)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Enumerator that increments over the visible paths starting at the passed in location. The ordering of the enumeration is based on how the paths are displayed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>

					public맜oid맙etExpandedState(TreePath맗ath,                      boolean말sExpanded)
				</name>
				<description>
					Marks the path path expanded state to isExpanded.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맚reeNodesChanged(TreeModelEvent만)
				</name>
				<description>
					Invoked after a node (or a set of siblings) has changed in some way. The node(s) have not changed locations in the tree or altered their children arrays, but other attributes have changed and may affect presentation. Example: the name of a file has changed, but it is in the same location in the file system. e.path() returns the path the parent of the changed node(s). e.childIndices() returns the index(es) of the changed node(s).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맚reeNodesInserted(TreeModelEvent만)
				</name>
				<description>
					Invoked after nodes have been inserted into the tree. e.path() returns the parent of the new nodes e.childIndices() returns the indices of the new nodes in ascending order.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맚reeNodesRemoved(TreeModelEvent만)
				</name>
				<description>
					Invoked after nodes have been removed from the tree. Note that if a subtree is removed from the tree, this method may only be invoked once for the root of the removed subtree, not once for each individual set of siblings removed. e.path() returns the former parent of the deleted nodes. e.childIndices() returns the indices the nodes had before they were deleted in ascending order.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맚reeStructureChanged(TreeModelEvent만)
				</name>
				<description>
					Invoked after the tree has drastically changed structure from a given node down. If the path returned by e.getPath() is of length one and the first element does not identify the current root node the first element should become the new root of the tree. e.path() holds the path to the node. e.childIndices() returns null.
