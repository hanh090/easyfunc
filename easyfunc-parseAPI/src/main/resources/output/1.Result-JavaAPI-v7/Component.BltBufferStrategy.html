			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid맋ispose()
				</name>
				<description>
					Releases system resources currently consumed by this BufferStrategy and removes it from the associated Component. After invoking this method, getBufferStrategy will return null. Trying to use a BufferStrategy after it has been disposed will result in undefined behavior.
				</description>

				<description>
					Creates the back buffers
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicBufferCapabilities많etCapabilities()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:BufferStrategy Returns the BufferCapabilities for this BufferStrategy.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicGraphics많etDrawGraphics()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:BufferStrategy Creates a graphics context for the drawing buffer. This method may not be synchronized for performance reasons; use of this method by multiple threads should be handled at the application level. Disposal of the graphics object obtained must be handled by the application.

				<description>
					Makes the next available buffer visible.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected맜oidrevalidate()

				<description>
					Restore the drawing buffer if it has been lost
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean맊ontentsLost()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:BufferStrategy Returns whether the drawing buffer was lost since the last call to getDrawGraphics. Since the buffers in a buffer strategy are usually type VolatileImage, they may become lost. For a discussion on lost buffers, see VolatileImage.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean맊ontentsRestored()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:BufferStrategy Returns whether the drawing buffer was recently restored from a lost state and reinitialized to the default background color (white). Since the buffers in a buffer strategy are usually type VolatileImage, they may become lost. If a surface has been recently restored from a lost state since the last call to getDrawGraphics, it may require repainting. For a discussion on lost buffers, see VolatileImage.
