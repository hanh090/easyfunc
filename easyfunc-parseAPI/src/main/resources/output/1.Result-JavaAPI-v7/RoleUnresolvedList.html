			<method>
				<name>
					publicRoleUnresolvedList()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an empty RoleUnresolvedList.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicRoleUnresolvedList(int말nitialCapacity)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an empty RoleUnresolvedList with the initial capacity specified.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					publicRoleUnresolvedList(List<RoleUnresolved>맓ist)                     throws IllegalArgumentException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a RoleUnresolvedList containing the elements of the List specified, in the order in which they are returned by the List's iterator. The RoleUnresolvedList instance has an initial capacity of 110% of the size of the List specified.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					publicList<RoleUnresolved>마sList()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return a view of this list as a List<RoleUnresolved>. Changes to the returned value are reflected by changes to the original RoleUnresolvedList and vice versa.

				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts the unresolved role specified as an element at the position specified. Elements with an index greater than or equal to the current position are shifted up.
				</description>

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the element at the position specified to be the unresolved role specified. The previous element at that position is discarded.

					public막oolean마ddAll(RoleUnresolvedListroleList)                 throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends all the elements in the RoleUnresolvedList specified to the end of the list, in the order in which they are returned by the Iterator of the RoleUnresolvedList specified.

			<method>
				<name>
					public맜oid마dd(int말ndex,         Object만lement)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:ㅁrrayList Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right (adds one to their indices).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public막oolean마ddAll(Collection<?>맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:ㅁrrayList Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list, in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's Iterator. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress. (This implies that the behavior of this call is undefined if the specified collection is this list, and this list is nonempty.)

					public막oolean마ddAll(int말ndex,               Collection<?>맊)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class:ㅁrrayList Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list, starting at the specified position. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right (increases their indices). The new elements will appear in the list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator.
