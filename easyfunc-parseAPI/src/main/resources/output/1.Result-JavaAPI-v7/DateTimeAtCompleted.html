		<description>
			Class DateTimeAtCompleted is a printing attribute class, a date-time attribute, that indicates the date and time at which the Print Job completed (or was canceled or aborted). To construct a DateTimeAtCompleted attribute from separate values of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, use a Calendar object to construct a Date object, then use the Date object to construct the DateTimeAtCompleted attribute. To convert a DateTimeAtCompleted attribute to separate values of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on, create a Calendar object and set it to the Date from the DateTimeAtCompleted attribute. IPP Compatibility: The information needed to construct an IPP "date-time-at-completed" attribute can be obtained as described above. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
