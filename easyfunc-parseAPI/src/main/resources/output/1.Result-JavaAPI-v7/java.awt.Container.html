		<description>
			A generic Abstract Window Toolkit(AWT) container object is a component that can contain other AWT components. Components added to a container are tracked in a list. The order of the list will define the components' front-to-back stacking order within the container. If no index is specified when adding a component to a container, it will be added to the end of the list (and hence to the bottom of the stacking order). Note: For details on the focus subsystem, see How to Use the Focus Subsystem, a section in The Java Tutorial, and the Focus Specification for more information.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Component add(Component comp)
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends the specified component to the end of this container. This is a convenience method for addImpl(java.awt.Component, java.lang.Object, int). This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to display the added component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Component add(String name,              Component comp)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified component to this container. This is a convenience method for addImpl(java.awt.Component, java.lang.Object, int). This method is obsolete as of 1.1. Please use the method add(Component, Object) instead. This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to display the added component.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Component add(Component comp,              int index)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified component to this container at the given position. This is a convenience method for addImpl(java.awt.Component, java.lang.Object, int). This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to display the added component.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setComponentZOrder(Component comp,                        int index)
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the specified component to the specified z-order index in the container. The z-order determines the order that components are painted; the component with the highest z-order paints first and the component with the lowest z-order paints last. Where components overlap, the component with the lower z-order paints over the component with the higher z-order. If the component is a child of some other container, it is removed from that container before being added to this container. The important difference between this method and java.awt.Container.add(Component, int) is that this method doesn't call removeNotify on the component while removing it from its previous container unless necessary and when allowed by the underlying native windowing system. This way, if the component has the keyboard focus, it maintains the focus when moved to the new position. This property is guaranteed to apply only to lightweight non-Container components. This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy. Note: Not all platforms support changing the z-order of heavyweight components from one container into another without the call to removeNotify. There is no way to detect whether a platform supports this, so developers shouldn't make any assumptions.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getComponentZOrder(Component comp)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the z-order index of the component inside the container. The higher a component is in the z-order hierarchy, the lower its index. The component with the lowest z-order index is painted last, above all other child components.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void add(Component comp,         Object constraints)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified component to the end of this container. Also notifies the layout manager to add the component to this container's layout using the specified constraints object. This is a convenience method for addImpl(java.awt.Component, java.lang.Object, int). This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to display the added component.

					public void add(Component comp,         Object constraints,         int index)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified component to this container with the specified constraints at the specified index. Also notifies the layout manager to add the component to the this container's layout using the specified constraints object. This is a convenience method for addImpl(java.awt.Component, java.lang.Object, int). This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to display the added component.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected void addImpl(Component comp,             Object constraints,             int index)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified component to this container at the specified index. This method also notifies the layout manager to add the component to this container's layout using the specified constraints object via the addLayoutComponent method. The constraints are defined by the particular layout manager being used. For example, the BorderLayout class defines five constraints: BorderLayout.NORTH, BorderLayout.SOUTH, BorderLayout.EAST, BorderLayout.WEST, and BorderLayout.CENTER. The GridBagLayout class requires a GridBagConstraints object. Failure to pass the correct type of constraints object results in an IllegalArgumentException. If the current layout manager implements LayoutManager2, then LayoutManager2.addLayoutComponent(Component,Object) is invoked on it. If the current layout manager does not implement LayoutManager2, and constraints is a String, then LayoutManager.addLayoutComponent(String,Component) is invoked on it. If the component is not an ancestor of this container and has a non-null parent, it is removed from its current parent before it is added to this container. This is the method to override if a program needs to track every add request to a container as all other add methods defer to this one. An overriding method should usually include a call to the superclass's version of the method: super.addImpl(comp, constraints, index) This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to display the added component.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void remove(int index)

				<description>
					Removes the component, specified by index, from this container. This method also notifies the layout manager to remove the component from this container's layout via the removeLayoutComponent method. This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy. If the container has already been displayed, the hierarchy must be validated thereafter in order to reflect the changes.

					Causes this container to lay out its components. Most programs should not call this method directly, but should invoke the validate method instead.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					@Deprecated  public void layout()
				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated. As of JDK version 1.1, replaced by doLayout().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isValidateRoot()
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates if this container is a validate root. Layout-related changes, such as bounds of the validate root descendants, do not affect the layout of the validate root parent. This peculiarity enables the invalidate() method to stop invalidating the component hierarchy when the method encounters a validate root. However, to preserve backward compatibility this new optimized behavior is enabled only when the java.awt.smartInvalidate system property value is set to true. If a component hierarchy contains validate roots and the new optimized invalidate() behavior is enabled, the validate() method must be invoked on the validate root of a previously invalidated component to restore the validity of the hierarchy later. Otherwise, calling the validate() method on the top-level container (such as a Frame object) should be used to restore the validity of the component hierarchy. The Window class and the Applet class are the validate roots in AWT. Swing introduces more validate roots.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void invalidate()
				</name>
				<description>
					Invalidates the container. If the LayoutManager installed on this container is an instance of the LayoutManager2 interface, then the LayoutManager2.invalidateLayout(Container) method is invoked on it supplying this Container as the argument. Afterwards this method marks this container invalid, and invalidates its ancestors. See the Component.invalidate() method for more details.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void validate()
				</name>
				<description>
					Validates this container and all of its subcomponents. Validating a container means laying out its subcomponents. Layout-related changes, such as setting the bounds of a component, or adding a component to the container, invalidate the container automatically. Note that the ancestors of the container may be invalidated also (see Component.invalidate() for details.) Therefore, to restore the validity of the hierarchy, the validate() method should be invoked on the top-most invalid container of the hierarchy. Validating the container may be a quite time-consuming operation. For performance reasons a developer may postpone the validation of the hierarchy till a set of layout-related operations completes, e.g. after adding all the children to the container. If this Container is not valid, this method invokes the validateTree method and marks this Container as valid. Otherwise, no action is performed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void validateTree()
				</name>
				<description>
					Recursively descends the container tree and recomputes the layout for any subtrees marked as needing it (those marked as invalid). Synchronization should be provided by the method that calls this one: validate.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setFont(Font f)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the font of this container. This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Dimension getPreferredSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the preferred size of this container. If the preferred size has not been set explicitly by Component.setPreferredSize(Dimension) and this Container has a non-null LayoutManager, then LayoutManager.preferredLayoutSize(Container) is used to calculate the preferred size. Note: some implementations may cache the value returned from the LayoutManager. Implementations that cache need not invoke preferredLayoutSize on the LayoutManager every time this method is invoked, rather the LayoutManager will only be queried after the Container becomes invalid.

					public Dimension getMinimumSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the minimum size of this container. If the minimum size has not been set explicitly by Component.setMinimumSize(Dimension) and this Container has a non-null LayoutManager, then LayoutManager.minimumLayoutSize(Container) is used to calculate the minimum size. Note: some implementations may cache the value returned from the LayoutManager. Implementations that cache need not invoke minimumLayoutSize on the LayoutManager every time this method is invoked, rather the LayoutManager will only be queried after the Container becomes invalid.

				<name>
					public Dimension getMaximumSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the maximum size of this container. If the maximum size has not been set explicitly by Component.setMaximumSize(Dimension) and the LayoutManager installed on this Container is an instance of LayoutManager2, then LayoutManager2.maximumLayoutSize(Container) is used to calculate the maximum size. Note: some implementations may cache the value returned from the LayoutManager2. Implementations that cache need not invoke maximumLayoutSize on the LayoutManager2 every time this method is invoked, rather the LayoutManager2 will only be queried after the Container becomes invalid.

			<method>
				<name>
					public float getAlignmentX()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the alignment along the x axis. This specifies how the component would like to be aligned relative to other components. The value should be a number between 0 and 1 where 0 represents alignment along the origin, 1 is aligned the furthest away from the origin, 0.5 is centered, etc.

					public void paint(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Paints the container. This forwards the paint to any lightweight components that are children of this container. If this method is reimplemented, super.paint(g) should be called so that lightweight components are properly rendered. If a child component is entirely clipped by the current clipping setting in g, paint() will not be forwarded to that child.

				<name>
					public <T extends EventListener> T[] getListeners(Class<T> listenerType)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as FooListeners upon this Container. FooListeners are registered using the addFooListener method. You can specify the listenerType argument with a class literal, such as FooListener.class. For example, you can query a Container c for its container listeners with the following code: ContainerListener[] cls = (ContainerListener[])(c.getListeners(ContainerListener.class)); If no such listeners exist, this method returns an empty array.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected void processEvent(AWTEvent e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Processes events on this container. If the event is a ContainerEvent, it invokes the processContainerEvent method, else it invokes its superclass's processEvent. Note that if the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected void processContainerEvent(ContainerEvent e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Processes container events occurring on this container by dispatching them to any registered ContainerListener objects. NOTE: This method will not be called unless container events are enabled for this component; this happens when one of the following occurs: A ContainerListener object is registered via addContainerListener Container events are enabled via enableEvents Note that if the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception.

					public Component getComponentAt(int x,                         int y)
				</name>
				<description>
					Locates the component that contains the x,y position. The top-most child component is returned in the case where there is overlap in the components. This is determined by finding the component closest to the index 0 that claims to contain the given point via Component.contains(), except that Components which have native peers take precedence over those which do not (i.e., lightweight Components).

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the position of the mouse pointer in this Container's coordinate space if the Container is under the mouse pointer, otherwise returns null. This method is similar to Component.getMousePosition() with the exception that it can take the Container's children into account. If allowChildren is false, this method will return a non-null value only if the mouse pointer is above the Container directly, not above the part obscured by children. If allowChildren is true, this method returns a non-null value if the mouse pointer is above Container or any of its descendants.

				<description>
					Locates the visible child component that contains the specified position. The top-most child component is returned in the case where there is overlap in the components. If the containing child component is a Container, this method will continue searching for the deepest nested child component. Components which are not visible are ignored during the search. The findComponentAt method is different from getComponentAt in that getComponentAt only searches the Container's immediate children; if the containing component is a Container, findComponentAt will search that child to find a nested component.

					public void setFocusTraversalKeys(int id,                           Set<? extends AWTKeyStroke> keystrokes)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the focus traversal keys for a given traversal operation for this Container. The default values for a Container's focus traversal keys are implementation-dependent. Sun recommends that all implementations for a particular native platform use the same default values. The recommendations for Windows and Unix are listed below. These recommendations are used in the Sun AWT implementations. Identifier Meaning Default KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS Normal forward keyboard traversal TAB on KEY_PRESSED, CTRL-TAB on KEY_PRESSED KeyboardFocusManager.BACKWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS Normal reverse keyboard traversal SHIFT-TAB on KEY_PRESSED, CTRL-SHIFT-TAB on KEY_PRESSED KeyboardFocusManager.UP_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS Go up one focus traversal cycle none KeyboardFocusManager.DOWN_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS Go down one focus traversal cycle none To disable a traversal key, use an empty Set; Collections.EMPTY_SET is recommended. Using the AWTKeyStroke API, client code can specify on which of two specific KeyEvents, KEY_PRESSED or KEY_RELEASED, the focus traversal operation will occur. Regardless of which KeyEvent is specified, however, all KeyEvents related to the focus traversal key, including the associated KEY_TYPED event, will be consumed, and will not be dispatched to any Container. It is a runtime error to specify a KEY_TYPED event as mapping to a focus traversal operation, or to map the same event to multiple default focus traversal operations. If a value of null is specified for the Set, this Container inherits the Set from its parent. If all ancestors of this Container have null specified for the Set, then the current KeyboardFocusManager's default Set is used.

					Returns the Set of focus traversal keys for a given traversal operation for this Container. (See setFocusTraversalKeys for a full description of each key.) If a Set of traversal keys has not been explicitly defined for this Container, then this Container's parent's Set is returned. If no Set has been explicitly defined for any of this Container's ancestors, then the current KeyboardFocusManager's default Set is returned.

					Returns whether the Set of focus traversal keys for the given focus traversal operation has been explicitly defined for this Container. If this method returns false, this Container is inheriting the Set from an ancestor, or from the current KeyboardFocusManager.

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isFocusCycleRoot(Container container)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether the specified Container is the focus cycle root of this Container's focus traversal cycle. Each focus traversal cycle has only a single focus cycle root and each Container which is not a focus cycle root belongs to only a single focus traversal cycle. Containers which are focus cycle roots belong to two cycles: one rooted at the Container itself, and one rooted at the Container's nearest focus-cycle-root ancestor. This method will return true for both such Containers in this case.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setFocusTraversalPolicy(FocusTraversalPolicy policy)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the focus traversal policy that will manage keyboard traversal of this Container's children, if this Container is a focus cycle root. If the argument is null, this Container inherits its policy from its focus- cycle-root ancestor. If the argument is non-null, this policy will be inherited by all focus-cycle-root children that have no keyboard- traversal policy of their own (as will, recursively, their focus-cycle- root children). If this Container is not a focus cycle root, the policy will be remembered, but will not be used or inherited by this or any other Containers until this Container is made a focus cycle root.

			<method>
				<name>
					public FocusTraversalPolicy getFocusTraversalPolicy()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the focus traversal policy that will manage keyboard traversal of this Container's children, or null if this Container is not a focus cycle root. If no traversal policy has been explicitly set for this Container, then this Container's focus-cycle-root ancestor's policy is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isFocusTraversalPolicySet()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether the focus traversal policy has been explicitly set for this Container. If this method returns false, this Container will inherit its focus traversal policy from an ancestor.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setFocusCycleRoot(boolean focusCycleRoot)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets whether this Container is the root of a focus traversal cycle. Once focus enters a traversal cycle, typically it cannot leave it via focus traversal unless one of the up- or down-cycle keys is pressed. Normal traversal is limited to this Container, and all of this Container's descendants that are not descendants of inferior focus cycle roots. Note that a FocusTraversalPolicy may bend these restrictions, however. For example, ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy supports implicit down-cycle traversal. The alternative way to specify the traversal order of this Container's children is to make this Container a focus traversal policy provider.

					public final void setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider(boolean provider)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets whether this container will be used to provide focus traversal policy. Container with this property as true will be used to acquire focus traversal policy instead of closest focus cycle root ancestor.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final boolean isFocusTraversalPolicyProvider()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether this container provides focus traversal policy. If this property is set to true then when keyboard focus manager searches container hierarchy for focus traversal policy and encounters this container before any other container with this property as true or focus cycle roots then its focus traversal policy will be used instead of focus cycle root's policy.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void transferFocusDownCycle()
				</name>
				<description>
					Transfers the focus down one focus traversal cycle. If this Container is a focus cycle root, then the focus owner is set to this Container's default Component to focus, and the current focus cycle root is set to this Container. If this Container is not a focus cycle root, then no focus traversal operation occurs.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation o)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the ComponentOrientation property of this container and all components contained within it. This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list. The listener is registered for all bound properties of this class, including the following: this Container's font ("font") this Container's background color ("background") this Container's foreground color ("foreground") this Container's focusability ("focusable") this Container's focus traversal keys enabled state ("focusTraversalKeysEnabled") this Container's Set of FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS ("forwardFocusTraversalKeys") this Container's Set of BACKWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS ("backwardFocusTraversalKeys") this Container's Set of UP_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS ("upCycleFocusTraversalKeys") this Container's Set of DOWN_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS ("downCycleFocusTraversalKeys") this Container's focus traversal policy ("focusTraversalPolicy") this Container's focus-cycle-root state ("focusCycleRoot") Note that if this Container is inheriting a bound property, then no event will be fired in response to a change in the inherited property. If listener is null, no exception is thrown and no action is performed.

					public void addPropertyChangeListener(String propertyName,                               PropertyChangeListener listener)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list for a specific property. The specified property may be user-defined, or one of the following defaults: this Container's font ("font") this Container's background color ("background") this Container's foreground color ("foreground") this Container's focusability ("focusable") this Container's focus traversal keys enabled state ("focusTraversalKeysEnabled") this Container's Set of FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS ("forwardFocusTraversalKeys") this Container's Set of BACKWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS ("backwardFocusTraversalKeys") this Container's Set of UP_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS ("upCycleFocusTraversalKeys") this Container's Set of DOWN_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS ("downCycleFocusTraversalKeys") this Container's focus traversal policy ("focusTraversalPolicy") this Container's focus-cycle-root state ("focusCycleRoot") this Container's focus-traversal-policy-provider state("focusTraversalPolicyProvider") this Container's focus-traversal-policy-provider state("focusTraversalPolicyProvider") Note that if this Container is inheriting a bound property, then no event will be fired in response to a change in the inherited property. If listener is null, no exception is thrown and no action is performed.
