<h1>Setting the class path</h1>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
The class path is the path that the Java runtime environment
searches for classes and other resource files. The class search
path (more commonly known by the shorter name, "class path") can be
set using either the <code>-classpath</code> option when calling a
JDK tool (the preferred method) or by setting the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable. The
<code>-classpath</code> option is preferred because you can set it
individually for each application without affecting other
applications and without other applications modifying its value.

<dd>Class paths to the .jar, .zip or .class files. Each
<i>classpath</i> should end with a filename or directory depending
on what you are setting the class path to:
<ul>
<li>For a .jar or .zip file that contains .class files, the class
path ends with the name of the .zip or .jar file.</li>
<li>For .class files in an unnamed package, the class path ends
with the directory that contains the .class files.</li>
<li>For .class files in a named package, the class path ends with
the directory that contains the "root" package (the first package
in the full package name).</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple path entries are separated by semi-colons. With the
<code>set</code> command, it's important to omit spaces from around
the equals sign (=).</p>
<p>The default class path is the current directory. Setting the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> variable or using the
<code>-classpath</code> command-line option overrides that default,
so if you want to include the current directory in the search path,
you must include "<b>.</b>" in the new settings.</p>
<p>Classpath entries that are neither directories nor archives
(.zip or .jar files) nor * are ignored.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The class path tells JDK tools and applications where to find
third-party and user-defined classes -- that is, classes that are
not Java <a href=
"../../guides/extensions/index.html">extensions</a> or part of the
Java platform. The class path needs to find any classes you've
compiled with the javac compiler -- its default is the current
directory to conveniently enable those classes to be found.</p>
<p>The JDK, the JVM and other JDK tools find classes by searching
the Java platform (bootstrap) classes, any extension classes, and
the class path, in that order. (For details on the search strategy,
see <a href="../findingclasses.html">How Classes Are Found</a>.)
Class libraries for most applications will want to take advantage
of the <a href="../../guides/extensions/index.html">extensions
mechanism</a>. You only need to set the class path when you want to
load a class that's (a) not in the current directory or in any of
its subdirectories, and (b) not in a location specified by the
extensions mechanism.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from an older version of the JDK, your
startup settings may include <code>CLASSPATH</code> settings that
are no longer needed. You should remove any settings that are not
application-specific, such as <code>classes.zip</code>. Some
third-party applications that use the Java Virtual Machine may
modify your <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable to include
the libaries they use. Such settings can remain.</p>
<p>You can change the class path by using the JDK tools' <a href=
"#tooloption">-classpath option</a> when you invoke the JVM or
other JDK tools or by using the <a href=
"#env_var"><code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable</a>. Using
the <code>-classpath</code> option is preferred over setting
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable because you can set it
individually for each application without affecting other
applications and without other applications modifying its
value.</p>
<p>Classes can be stored either in directories (folders) or in
archive files. The Java platform classes are stored in
<code>rt.jar</code>. For more details on archives and information
on how the class path works, see <a href=
"#Understanding">Understanding the class path and package names</a>
near the end of this document.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Important Note:</b> Some older versions of the JDK sofware
included a <code>&lt;</code><i>jdk-dir</i><code>&gt;/classes</code>
entry in the default class path. That directory exists for use by
the JDK software, and should <i>not</i> be used for application
classes. Application classes should be placed in a directory
outside of the JDK directory hierarcy. That way, installing a new
JDK does not force you to reinstall application classes. For
compatibility with older versions, applications that use the
<code>&lt;</code><i>jdk-dir</i><code>&gt;/classes</code> directory
as a class library will run in the current version, but there is no
guarantee that they will run in future versions.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="tooloption" id="tooloption"></a><b>Using the JDK
tools' -classpath option</b></h2>
<p>The JDK tools <a href="java.html">java</a>, <a href=
"jdb.html">jdb</a>, <a href="javac.html">javac</a>, and <a href=
"javah.html">javah</a> have a <code><b>-classpath</b></code> option
which replaces the path or paths specified by the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable while the tool runs.
This is the recommended option for changing class path settings,
because each application can have the class path it needs without
interfering with any other application.</p>
<p>The runtime tool <a href="java.html">java</a> has a
<code><b>-cp</b></code> option, as well. This option is an
abbreviation for <code><b>-classpath</b></code>.</p>
<p>For very special cases, both <a href="java.html">java</a> and
<a href="javac.html">javac</a> have options that let you change the
path they use to find their own class libraries. The vast majority
of users will never to need to use those options, however.</p>
<h2><a name="env_var" id="env_var"></a>Using the CLASSPATH
environment variable</h2>
<p>In general, you will want to use the <code>-classpath</code>
command-line option, as explained in the previous section. This
section shows you how to set the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment
variable if you want to do that, or clear settings left over from a
previous installation.</p>
<h3><b>Setting CLASSPATH</b></h3>
<p>The <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable is modified with
the <b>set</b> command. The format is:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<b>set CLASSPATH=</b><i>path1</i><b>;</b><i>path2</i>
...
    
</pre>
<p>The paths should begin with the letter specifying the drive, for
example, <code>C:\</code>. That way, the classes will still be
found if you happen to switch to a different drive. (If the path
entries start with backslash (<code>\</code>) and you are on drive
<code>D:</code>, for example, then the classes will be expected on
<code>D:</code>, rather than<code>C:</code>.)</p>
<h3><b>Clearing CLASSPATH</b></h3>
<p>If your <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable has been set
to a value that is not correct, or if your startup file or script
is setting an incorrect path, you can unset <code>CLASSPATH</code>
by using:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
      C:&gt; <b>set CLASSPATH=</b>
    
</pre>
<p>This command unsets <code>CLASSPATH</code> for the current
command prompt window only. You should also delete or modify your
startup settings to ensure that you have the right
<code>CLASSPATH</code> settings in future sessions.</p>
<h3><b>Changing Startup Settings</b></h3>
If the <code>CLASSPATH</code> variable is set at system startup,
the place to look for it depends on your operating system:

<h2>Understanding class path wildcards</h2>
<p>Class path entries can contain the basename wildcard character
*, which is considered equivalent to specifying a list of all the
files in the directory with the extension <code>.jar</code> or
<code>.JAR</code>. For example, the class path entry
<code>foo/*</code> specifies all JAR files in the directory named
<code>foo</code>. A classpath entry consisting simply of * expands
to a list of all the jar files in the current directory.</p>
<p>A class path entry that contains * will not match class files.
To match both classes and JAR files in a single directory
<code>foo</code>, use either <code>foo;foo/*</code> or
<code>foo/*;foo</code>. The order chosen determines whether the
classes and resources in <code>foo</code> are loaded before JAR
files in <code>foo</code>, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Subdirectories are not searched recursively. For example,
<code>foo/*</code> looks for JAR files only in <code>foo</code>,
not in <code>foo/bar</code>, <code>foo/baz</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The order in which the JAR files in a directory are enumerated
in the expanded class path is not specified and may vary from
platform to platform and even from moment to moment on the same
machine. A well-constructed application should not depend upon any
particular order. If a specific order is required then the JAR
files can be enumerated explicitly in the class path.</p>
<p>Expansion of wildcards is done early, prior to the invocation of
a program's <code>main</code> method, rather than late, during the
class-loading process itself. Each element of the input class path
containing a wildcard is replaced by the (possibly empty) sequence
of elements generated by enumerating the JAR files in the named
directory. For example, if the directory <code>foo</code> contains
<code>a.jar</code>, <code>b.jar</code>, and <code>c.jar</code>,
then the class path <code>foo/*</code> is expanded into
<code>foo/a.jar;foo/b.jar;foo/c.jar</code>, and that string would
be the value of the system property
<code>java.class.path</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable is not treated
any differently from the <code>-classpath</code> (or
<code>-cp</code>) command-line option. That is, wildcards are
honored in all these cases. However, class path wildcards are not
honored in the <code>Class-Path</code> jar-manifest header.</p>
<h2><a name="Understanding" id="Understanding"></a>Understanding
the class path and package names</h2>
<p>Java classes are organized into packages which are mapped to
directories in the file system. But, unlike the file system,
whenever you specify a package name, you specify the <i>whole</i>
package name -- never part of it. For example, the package name for
<code>java.awt.Button</code> is <i>always</i> specified as
<code>java.awt</code>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want the Java runtime to find a class
named <code>Cool.class</code> in the package
<code>utility.myapp</code>. If the path to that directory is
<code>C:\java\MyClasses\utility\myapp</code>, you would set the
class path so that it contains <code>C:\java\MyClasses</code>.</p>
<p>To run that app, you could use the following JVM command:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
C:&gt; <b>java -classpath C:\java\MyClasses utility.myapp.Cool</b>
    
</pre>
<p>When the app runs, the JVM uses the class path settings to find
any other classes defined in the <code>utility.myapp</code> package
that are used by the <code>Cool</code> class.</p>
<p>Note that the entire package name is specified in the command.
It is not possible, for example, to set the class path so it
contains <code>C:\java\MyClasses\utility</code> and use the command
<code>java myapp.Cool</code>. The class would not be found.</p>
<p>(You may be wondering what defines the package name for a class.
The answer is that the package name is part of the class and cannot
be modified, except by recompiling the class.)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Note:</b> An interesting consequence of the package
specification mechanism is that files which are part of the same
package may actually exist in different directories. The package
name will be the same for each class, but the path to each file may
start from a different directory in the class path.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Folders and archive files</h3>
<p>When classes are stored in a directory (folder), like
<code>c:\java\MyClasses\utility\myapp</code>, then the class path
entry points to the directory that contains the first element of
the package name. (in this case, <code>C:\java\MyClasses</code>,
since the package name is <code>utility.myapp</code>.)</p>
<p>But when classes are stored in an archive file (a .zip or .jar
file) the class path entry is the path to and including the .zip or
.jar file. For example, to use a class library that is in a .jar
file, the command would look something like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
C:&gt; <b>java -classpath C:\java\MyClasses\myclasses.jar utility.myapp.Cool</b>
    
</pre>
<h3>Multiple specifications</h3>
<p>To find class files in the directory
<code>C:\java\MyClasses</code> as well as classes in
<code>C:\java\OtherClasses</code>, you would set the class path
to:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
C:&gt; <b>java -classpath C:\java\MyClasses;C:\java\OtherClasses</b> ...
    
</pre>
<p>Note that the two paths are separated by a semicolon.</p>
<h3>Specification order</h3>
<p>The order in which you specify multiple class path entries is
important. The Java interpreter will look for classes in the
directories in the order they appear in the class path variable. In
the example above, the Java interpreter will first look for a
needed class in the directory <code>C:\java\MyClasses</code>. Only
if it doesn't find a class with the proper name in that directory
will the interpreter look in the <code>C:\java\OtherClasses</code>
directory.</p>
