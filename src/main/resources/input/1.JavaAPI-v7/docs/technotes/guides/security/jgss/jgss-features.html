<h2>Java Generic Security Services (Java GSS) and Kerberos
Enhancements for Java SE 6</h2>

<p>The following enhancements were added to the Java GSS/Kerberos
implementation in Java SE 6. 
<!-- Please send feedback related to these new features to java-security@sun.com. --></p>

<!-- insert new detailed copy here -->
<ul>
<li><b>Support for AES encryption type</b><br />
<br />
J2SE 5.0 supports DES and Triple DES encryption type, with
following aliases:<br />
<br />
<code>des-cbc-md5<br />
des-cbc-crc<br />
des3-cbc-sha1<br />
<br />
</code> Starting from Java SE 6, support for AES encryption type
(AES128 and AES256) in Java GSS/Kerberos is available. This
improves interoperability of the Java SE Kerberos implementation
with other Kerberos implementations, such as Solaris 10 and MIT
Kerberos.<br />
<br />
AES encryption type is specified in the Kerberos configuration
file under the <code>libdefaults</code> section. It is specified
as follows, with following tags: <code>default_tkt_enctypes,
default_tgs_enctypes, permitted_enctypes.</code><br />
<br />
(AES128 encryption type)<br />
<br />
<code>aes128-cts<br />
aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96<br />
<br />
</code> (AES256 encryption type)<br />
<br />
<code>aes256-cts<br />
aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96<br />
<br />
</code> <b>NOTE:</b> The JCE framework within JDK includes an
ability to enforce restrictions regarding the cryptographic
algorithms and maximum cryptographic strengths available to
applications. Such restrictions are specified in "jurisdiction
policy files". The jurisdiction policy files bundled in Java SE
limits the maximum key length. Hence, in order to use AES256
encryption type, you will need to install the JCE crypto policy
with the unlimited version to allow AES with 256-bit key.<br />
<br />
For example, the <code>libdefaults</code> section in the
configuration file might include the following.<br />
<br />
<code>default_tkt_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5
des-cbc-crc<br />
default_tgs_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5
des-cbc-crc<br />
permitted_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5
des-cbc-crc<br />
<br />
</code> <code>default_tkt_enctypes</code> is used to specify the
encryption types to use for the session key in the
ticket-granting-ticket. It is used by the client to restrict the
encryption types of session keys that will be used to communicate
with the KDC. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code> .<br />
<br />
<code>default_tgs_enctypes</code> is used to specify the
encryption types to use for the session key in service tickets.
It is used by the client to restrict the encryption types of
session keys that are shared by the client and server. The
default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1
aes128-cts</code>.<br />
<br />
<code>permitted_enctypes</code> is used to specify the encryption
types permitted to be used by a service. It is used by the server
to restrict the encryption types of session keys that it will
accept. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code>.</li>

<li><b>Support for RC4-HMAC encryption type</b><br />
<br />
J2SE 5.0 already supports DES and Triple DES encryption type,
with following aliases:<br />
<code>des-cbc-md5<br />
des-cbc-crc<br />
des3-cbc-sha1<br />
<br />
</code> Starting from Java SE 6, support for RC4-HMAC encryption
type in Java GSS/Kerberos is available. This improves
interoperability of the Java SE Kerberos implementation with
other Kerberos implementations, such as Windows, Solaris 10 and
MIT Kerberos. Windows Active Directoiory supports RC4-HMAC as the
default Kerberos encryption type.<br />
<br />
RC4-HMAC encryption type is specified in the Kerberos
configuration file under the <code>libdefaults</code> section. It
is specified as follows, with following tags:
<code>default_tkt_enctypes, default_tgs_enctypes,
permitted_enctypes.</code><br />
<br />
<code>rc4-hmac<br />
arcfour-hmac<br />
arcfour-hmac-md5<br />
<br />
</code> For example, the libdefaults section in the configuration
file might include the following.<br />
<br />
<code>default_tkt_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 rc4-hmac
des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc<br />
default_tgs_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 rc4-hmac
des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc<br />
permitted_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 rc4-hmac
des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc<br />
<br />
</code> <code>default_tkt_enctypes</code> is used to specify the
encryption types to use for the session key in the
ticket-granting-ticket. It is used by the client to restrict the
encryption types of session keys that will be used to communicate
with the KDC. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
rc4-hmac des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code><br />
<br />
<code>default_tgs_enctypes</code> is used to specify the
encryption types to use for the session key in service tickets.
It is used by the client to restrict the encryption types of
session keys that are shared by the client and server. The
default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc rc4-hmac
des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code>.<br />
<br />
<code>permitted_enctypes</code> is used to specify the encryption
types permitted to be used by a service. It is used by the server
to restrict the encryption types of session keys that it will
accept. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
rc4-hmac des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code>.<br />
<br />
<!-- ======================================= --></li>

<li><b>Support for SPNEGO in Java GSS</b><br />
<br />
Java SE now supports SPNEGO mechanism in Java GSS.<br />
<br />
Java GSS is a framework that can support multiple security
mechanisms; however GSS-API does not prescribe the method by
which GSS-API peers can establish whether they have a common
security mechanism. The Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation
(SPNEGO) mechanism is a pseudo security mechanism that enables
GSS-API peers to securely negotiate a common security mechanism
to be used. The SPNEGO protocol is used to negotiate which
security mechanism should be adopted.<br />
<br />
Currently Java GSS applications specify a unique object
identifier (OID) to select the underlying security mechanism. For
e.g. Java GSS applications specify Kerberos mechanism <code>OID
"1.2.840.113554.1.2.2</code> to use Kerberos mechanism. <code>Oid
mechOid = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");</code><br />
<br />
To select SPNEGO security mechanism, Java GSS applications would
need to specify the SPNEGO mechanism <code>OID
"1.3.6.1.5.5.2".</code> <code>Oid mechOid = new
Oid("1.3.6.1.5.5.2);</code><br />
<br />
Support for SPNEGO improves interoperability with Microsoft
products. SPNEGO protocol is heavily used to interoperate with
Microsoft server over HTTP, to support HTTP-Based Cross-Platform
Authentication via the Negotiate Protocol. Java SE now supports
SPNEGO authentication scheme in HTTP as well. Please check list
of new networking features for Java SE 6.<br />
<br />
<!-- ======================================= --></li>

<li><b>Support for new Pre-Authentication mechanisms</b><br />
<br />
Java SE now includes support for the new pre-authentication
mechanisms.<br />
<br />
Kerberos is a protocol for verifying the identity of principals.
The Kerberos protocol provides a mechanism called
pre-authentication for proving the identity of a principal and
for better protecting the long-term secret of the
principal.<br />
<br />
Kerberos specification defines a framework for Kerberos
pre-authentication mechanisms. Lastest Kerberos specification
defines new pre-authentication mechanisms to notify the client
which key to use, salt updates, and other additional parameters.
The new pre-authentication mechanisms indicate a requirement for
additional pre-authentication.<br />
<br />
With the support of new pre-authentication mechanisms, Java
GSS/Kerberos client can now handle the salt value updates when
required.<br />
<br />
<!-- ======================================= --></li>

<li><b>Native platform GSS integration</b><br />
<p>This feature allows Java applications to take advantage of
features in native GSS implementation available on the platform.
To enable Java GSS to delegate to the native GSS library and its
list of native mechanisms, set the system property
"sun.security.jgss.native" to true. When enabled, Java GSS would
look for native GSS library using the operating system specific
name, e.g. Solaris: libgss.so vs Linux: libgssapi.so. If the
desired GSS library has a different name or is not located under
a directory for system libraries, then its full path should be
specified using the system property "sun.security.jgss.lib".</p>

<p>For Java SE 6, the native GSS support is limited to Solaris
and Linux. Setting these system properties on platforms which
native GSS integration is not supported will be ignored.</p>

<p>Unlike the default Java GSS implementation which relies on
JAAS KerberosLoginModule for initial credential acquisition, when
using native GSS, the initial credential should be acquired
beforehand, e.g. kinit, prior to calling JGSS APIs.</p>

<p>In addition, when performing operations as a particular
Subject, e.g. Subject.doAs(...) or Subject.doAsPrivileged(...),
the to-be-used GSSCredential should be added to Subject's private
credential set. Otherwise, the GSS operations will fail since no
credential is found.<br />
</p>
</li>

<li><b>JAAS Login Entry Names Changes</b><br />
<br />
The JAAS login entry names for both SunJSSE and JGSS are unified,
and can be specified separately for different mechanisms. For
Kerberos 5, the names are 

<pre>
com.sun.security.jgss.krb5.initiate
com.sun.security.jgss.krb5.accept

</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Java Generic Security Services (Java GSS) and Kerberos
Enhancements for J2SE 5.0</h2>

<!--

Fixed 4837364: KerberosLoginModule should support TGT renews
Fixed 4642044: add SunJSSE support for the Kerberos cipher suites
        (com.sun.net.ssl.client/com.sun.net.ssl.server index names
        for Krb5LoginModule)
-->
<p>The following enhancements were added to the Java GSS/Kerberos
implementation in J2SE 5.0. 
<!-- Please send feedback related to these new features to 
<a href=mailto:java-security@sun.com>java-security@sun.com</a> --></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Support for Triple DES encryption type.</b><br />
Prior to J2SE 5.0, only the DES encryption type was supported.
J2SE 5.0 supports both DES and Triple DES encryption type. This
improves interoperability of the Java SE Kerberos implementation
with other Kerberos implementations, such as Solaris 10 and MIT
Kerberos. 

<p>Triple DES encryption type is specified in the Kerberos
configuration file under the "<tt>libdefaults</tt>" section. It
is specified as "<tt>des3-cbc-sha1</tt>" with following tags:
<tt>default_tkt_enctypes</tt>, <tt>default_tgs_enctypes</tt>,
<tt>permitted_enctypes</tt>. "<tt>dec3-cbc-sha1</tt>" has the
following aliases:</p>

<pre>
des3-hmac-sha1
des3-cbc-sha1-kd
des3-cbc-hmac-sha1-kd

</pre>

For example, the libdefaults section in the configuration file
might include the following. 

<pre>
default_tkt_enctypes = des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
default_tgs_enctypes = des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
permitted_enctypes   = des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc

</pre>

<tt>default_tkt_enctypes</tt> is used to specify the encryption
types to use for the session key in the ticket-granting-ticket.
It is used by the client to restrict the encryption types of
session keys that will be used to communicate with the KDC. The
default value is "<tt>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1</tt>"


<p><tt>default_tgs_enctypes</tt> is used to specify the
encryption types to use for the session key in service tickets.
It is used by the client to restrict the encryption types of
session keys that are shared by the client and server. The
default value is "<tt>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
des3-cbc-sha1</tt>".</p>

<p><tt>permitted_enctypes</tt> is used to specify the encryption
types permitted to be used by a service. It is used by the server
to restrict the encryption types of session keys that it will
accept. The default value is "<tt>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
des3-cbc-sha1</tt>".</p>
</li>

<li><b>TCP vs. UDP Preference Configuration</b><br />
Java SE now supports the use of the
"<tt>udp_preference_limit</tt>" property in the Kerberos
configuration file (<tt>krb5.conf</tt>). 

<p>When sending a message to the KDC, the Java SE Kerberos
library will use TCP if the size of the message is above
<tt>udp_preference_list</tt>. If the message is smaller than
<tt>udp_preference_list</tt>, then UDP will be tried at most
three times. If the KDC indicates that the request is too big,
the Java SE Kerberos library will use TCP.</p>
</li>

<li><b>IPv6 Support in Kerberos</b><br />
Java SE now supports IPv6 addresses in Kerberos tickets. Prior to
J2SE 5, only IPv4 addresses were supported in tickets.</li>

<li><strong>TGT Renewals</strong><br />
The <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jaas/index.html">Java
Authentication and Authorizaton Server (JAAS)</a> Kerberos login
module in JDK 5.0, <a href=
"../../../../jre/api/security/jaas/spec/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html">
<tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt></a>, now supports Ticket Granting Ticket
(TGT) renewal. This allows long-running services to renew their
TGT automatically without user interaction or requiring the
services to restart. 

<p>With this feature, if <tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt> obtains an
expired ticket from the ticket cache, the TGT will be
automatically renewed and be added to Subject of the caller who
requested the ticket. If the ticket cannot be renewed for any
reason, then <tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt> will use its configured
callback handler to retrieve a username and password to acquire a
new TGT.</p>

<p>To use this feature, configure <tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt> to use
the ticket cache and set the newly introduced <tt>renewTGT</tt>
option to <tt>true</tt>. Here is an example of a JAAS login
configuration file that requests TGT renewal.</p>

<pre>
server {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
        principal=<em>principal@your_realm</em>
        useTicketCache=true
        renewTGT=true;
};

</pre>

Note that if <tt>renewTGT</tt> is set to true, then
<tt>useTicketCache</tt> must also be set to true; otherwise, it
results in a configuration error.</li>

<li><strong>Login Entry Names for SunJSSE</strong><br />
In JDK 5.0, the SunJSSE provider has added support for the
Kerberos cipher suites, as described in <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2712.txt">RFC 2712</a> and the <a
href="../jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#WhatsNew">What's New in JSSE in
J2SE 5.0</a> in the JSSE Reference Guide. The following JAAS
login configuration index names are reserved for this feature. 

<pre>
com.sun.net.ssl.server
com.sun.net.ssl.client

</pre>

When a JSSE application uses the Kerberos cipher suites without
explicit JAAS program, the SunJSSE provider will use these index
names to find and configure the JAAS login module to acquire the
necessary Kerberos credentials. For example, such an application
might have the following JAAS configuration file. 

<pre>
 com.sun.net.ssl.server {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
        principal=<em>service_principal@your_realm</em>
        useKeyTab=true
        keyTab=<em>keytab_name</em>
        storeKey=true;
};

</pre>

If the entry is not found, the default "other" index name will be
used. The service name for TLS is "host". For example, a TLS
service running on a machine named "raven.example.com" in the
realm named "KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM" would have the service
principal name 

<pre>
host/raven.example.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM

</pre>

There are no restrictions on the TLS client; it may use any valid
Kerberos principal name. 

<p>When a JSSE application uses the Kerberos cipher suites with
explicit JAAS program, it can use any index name, including the
ones listed above.</p>

</ul>

<h2>New Features in Java GSS for Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v
1.4.2</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Configurable Kerberos Settings</b><br />
The Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) name and realm
settings are provided in the Kerberos configuration file or via
the system properties <code>java.security.krb5.kdc</code> and
<code>java.security.krb5.realm</code>. In previous releases,
changes to the Kerberos configuration values would only take
effect when an application was restarted. 

<p>In the 1.4.2 release of the Java platform, a new boolean
option <code>refreshKrb5Config</code> can be specified in the
entry for <code>Krb5LoginModule</code> in the JAAS configuration
file. If this option is set to <code>true</code>, the
configuration values will be refreshed before the
<code>login</code> method of the <code>Krb5LoginModule</code> is
called.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Support for Slave Kerberos Key Distribution
Center</b><br />
Kerberos allows the use of slave KDCs so that if the master KDC
is unavailable, the slave KDCs will respond to user requests. In
earlier releases of the Java SE, Sun's implementation of Kerberos
tried only the master KDC and would give up if there was no
response within the default KDC timeout specified in the Kerberos
configuration file, or 30 seconds if no timeout had been
specified. 

<p>With this 1.4.2 release, Sun's implementation of Kerberos will
retry with the slave KDC(s), if they are specified. The slave
KDCs can be specified in the Kerberos configuration file or via a
list of KDCs separated by a colon (<code>:</code>) in the system
property <code>java.security.krb5.kdc</code>.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Support TCP for Kerberos Key Distribution Center
Transport</b><br />
Sun's implementation of Kerberos implements Kerberos version 5
according to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1510.txt">RFC
1510</a> and uses UDP transport for ticket requests. A new
Internet draft updates this RFC. One of the added features is
required support for TCP as a transport in addition to UDP. As a
result, in cases where Kerberos tickets exceed the UDP packet
size limit, the KDC would return an error code indicating that
the request should be resent over TCP. 

<p>In the current 1.4.2 release, Sun's implementation of Kerberos
now supports automatic fallback to TCP. Therefore, if the
Kerberos ticket request using UDP fails and the KDC returns the
error code <code>KRB_ERR_RESPONSE_TOO_BIG</code>, TCP is
automatically the default transport. <!-- <P>
    The current draft which updates RFC 1510, is available online: 
<A href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications-04.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications-04.txt</A>. 
    </P></font> --></p>
</li>

<li><b>Kerberos Service Ticket in the Subject's Private
Credentials</b><br />
The Kerberos service ticket is now stored in the Subject's
private credentials. This change allows application developers
access to the service ticket so that it can be used outside the
JGSS (for example, in native applications or for proprietary
uses). In addition, the service ticket can now be reused if the
application tries to establish a security context to the same
service again. The service ticket should be valid for it to be
reusable. 

<p>Previously, when using Java Generic Security Services (JGSS)
over Kerberos V5, if the <code>
<!-- <a href="/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/ietf/jgss/package-summary.html"> -->
useSubjectCredsOnly <!-- </A> --></code> property was set to
true, the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) was retrieved from the
Subject and used to establish a GSS Security context. The service
ticket obtained was not stored in the Subject. Now the service
ticket is also stored in the Subject if
<code>useSubjectCredsOnly</code> is true.</p>

<p>If a client application searches through the Subject's private
credentials, in previous releases it would find only the TGT. As
of this release, it also will find any Service ticket(s)
obtained.</p>

<p>The bug report associated with this change is 4688866.</p>
