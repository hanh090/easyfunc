<p><b>Q: What is Java Plug-in Software?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Java Plug-in Software is a software product from Sun
Microsystems, Inc., that allows enterprise web managers to direct
Java applets and JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
components on their intranet web pages to run using Sun's Java
Runtime Environment (JRE). With the 1.4 release of Java Plug-in, it
is also allows the conventional APPLET tag to direct Java applets
to use Sun's JRE. This is especially useful in browser, such
Internet Explorer 6, that do not support Java.</p>
<p><b>Q: For whom is Java Plug-in Software intended?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Java Plug-in Software is designed for enterprise
customers who want to deploy Java SDK, Standard Edition based
applets on their intranet web pages, and support Microsoft
Windows-, Solaris-, and Linux-based browsers in their enterprise.
With the 1.4 release, it is also designed for the consumer who
wants to run Java applets on a web page.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is there documentation available for Java Plug-in
Software?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> To assist in your deployment of Java Plug-in Software,
Sun has made available a variety of technical documentation.
Documentation regarding the HTML specifications, using Java Plug-in
Software in intranet environments, how proxy configuration works,
how to script applets, and much more are available from the
<a href="../../../plugin/">Java Plug-in Software documentation page</a>.</p>
<p><b>Q: What features does Java Plug-in Software offer?</b></p>

<li>Free Java Plug-in Software</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q: What is the advantage of downloading and using Java
Plug-in Software rather than the browser's default
Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> virtual machine?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Using Java Plug-in Software allows enterprises and
consumers to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take full advantage of Java SDK, Standard Edition functionality
such as JavaBeans, JNI<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>, and RMI
today.</li>
<li>Develop and deploy 100% Pure Java<sup><font size=
"-2">SM</font></sup> applets on Internet Explorer and Netscape
Navigator browsers, and be assured that they will run reliably and
consistently in both browsers.</li>
<li>Be assured that they will receive support for the latest
releases of Sun's Java platform --including the high-performance
Java HotSpot<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> virtual
machine--in Internet Explorer and Navigator as soon as Sun releases
them.</li>
<li>Run applets in web browsers that no longer support Java.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Q: Is Java Plug-in Software included in the Java Software
Development Kit (SDK), Standard Edition?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software work on platforms other than
Microsoft Windows or Solaris (for example, Mac OS, AIX, Linux,
HP-UX, etc.) versions of IE or Navigator?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Sun has made Java Plug-in Software available for
porting to all operating system providers. For information about
support for Java Plug-in Software on other operating systems,
contact the operating system provider.</p>
<p><b>Q: What information should I provide when reporting a bug to
<a href=
"http://bugreport.sun.com/bugreport/">http://bugreport.sun.com/bugreport/</a></b></p>

<h2><b><a name="features"></a>Supported Features</b></h2>
<p><b>Q: Is Java Plug-in Software fully compliant with the JCK
(Java Compatibility Kit) test suite for Java SDK, Standard
Edition?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Java Plug-in Software is fully compliant with the JCK
test suite for Java SDK, Standard Edition.</p>
<p><b>Q: What browsers and operating systems does Java Plug-in
support?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> See <a href="../overview.html#supported">Supported
Operating Systems and Browsers</a>.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software support
scripting?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Java Plug-in Software supports scripting of applets in
Internet Explorer and Netscape 6. However, scripting is not
available when using Java Plug-in Software in Navigator 4.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software support signed applets?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, Java Plug-in Software supports standard Java SDK,
Standard Edition signed JARs and applets signed using Netscape
signing tools. See the <a href="../rsa_signing.html">How to Sign
Applets Using RSA-Signed Certificates</a> for more details.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software automatically recognize and use
the proxy server configuration that the browser was using?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> It can. There are in fact three options beginning with
the 1.4 release. See <a href="../proxie_config.html">Proxy
Configuration</a> for details.</p>
<p><b>Q: What protocol does Java Plug-in Software support over the
proxy?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, Gopher, and SOCKS are supported.</p>
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software support SSL?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, SSL is supported through Java Secure Socket
Extension (JSSE).</p>
<p><b>Q: Is there a way to pre-load Java Plug-in Software during
the browser startup?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator do not have
mechanisms to support pre-loading Java Plug-in Software during
startup. You can work around this limitation by providing your own
startup page that launches a dummy applet using Java Plug-in
Software.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I set up Java Plug-in Software to download from an
intranet web server (behind a firewall) rather than from Sun's web
site?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes. For more information, see <a href=
"../intranet.html">Intranet With
<code>OBJECT</code>/<code>EMBED</code> Tag</a> under Part II:
Deployment Schemes.</p>
<p><b>Q: How can I open the Java Plug-in Control Panel on Microsoft
Windows?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> On the Start menu, choose Start&gt;Settings&gt;Control
Panel, then double-click on the steaming Java cup icon labeled
<i>Java Plug-in</i>.</p>
<h2><b><a name="version"></a></b>Version Information</h2>
<p><b>Q: How can I tell what version of Java Plug-in Software has
been installed?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> There are a couple of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the version number in <tt>C:\Windows\Downloaded Program
Files\Java Runtime Environment</tt> or <code>C:\WINNT\Downloaded
Program Files\</code></li>
<li>Open Netscape Navigator. Go to the Help&gt;About Plugins. Check
the MIME types listed under Java Plug-in. If the following exist:
<p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.4</code>, you are
using Java Plug-in Software 1.4</p>
<p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.3</code>, you are
using Java Plug-in Software 1.3</p>
<p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.2</code>, you are
using Java Plug-in Software 1.2</p>
<p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.1.2</code>, you are
using Java Plug-in Software 1.1.2</p>
<p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.1.1</code>, you are
using Java Plug-in Software 1.1.1</p>
<p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.1</code>, you are
using Java Plug-in Software 1.1</p>
<p>Note: You may see more than one if you have multiple versions of
Java Plug-in installed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q: Can different versions of Java Plug-in Software co-exist
on the same system?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, it can be done through multi-version support. See
<a href="../version.html">Supporting Multiple Versions of JRE/Java
Plug-in</a>.</p>
