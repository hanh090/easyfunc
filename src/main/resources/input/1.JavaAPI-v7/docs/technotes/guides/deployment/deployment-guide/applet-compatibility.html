<h1>Applet Compatibility Issues</h1>
<br />
This document describes all known applet compatibility issues
between the Microsoft Virtual Machine (VM) and the Sun Java VM. The
term Java SE used here refers to the Java Platform Standard Edition
version 1.2 or later.
<h2><code><br />
ClassFormatError</code></h2>
<p>This error is caused by bytecode generated from old JDK 1.0.2 or
1.1 compilers. In the past, a lot of these compilers generated
bytecode that does not conform to the Java VM Specification. Since
the verifiers in recent J2SE releases are much stricter about bad
class format, the <code>ClassFormatError</code> is thrown by the VM
when these bad class files are loaded.</p>
<p>Some typical problems in some older class files are the
following (note that this list is not exhaustive):</p>
<ul>
<li>There are extra bytes at the end of the class file;</li>
<li>The class file contains method or field names that do not begin
with a letter;</li>
<li>The class attempts to access private members of another
class;</li>
<li>The class file has other format errors, including illegal
constant pool indices and illegal UTF-8 strings;</li>
<li>Some early (third-party) bytecode obfuscators produced class
files that violated proper class-file format.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can avoid this type of problem by recompiling your classes
with the Javac bytecode compiler from the current JDK. If you
choose to use a third-party obfuscator, be sure to use one that
produces class files that respect proper class-file format.</p>
<p>To allow some of the applets with bad class files to run in Java
SE, Java Plug-in contains a bytecode transformer to transform some
of the bad class files to good ones. Currently, only bad class
files with the following <code>ClassFormatError</code> may be
transformed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local variable name has bad constant pool index</li>
<li>Extra bytes at the end of the class file</li>
<li>Code segment has wrong length</li>
<li>Illegal Field/Method name</li>
<li>Illegal Field/Method modifiers</li>
<li>Invalid start_pc/length in local var table</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the following <code>ClassFormatError</code>
problems are not fixable by the bytecode transformer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Illegal use of nonvirtual function call</li>
<li>Arguments can't fit into locals</li>
<li>Unsorted lookup switch</li>
<li>Truncated class file</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, any class file having any of these problems will not run
under Java SE:</p>
<h2>Security exception with <code>sun.audio</code></h2>
<p>The <code>sun.audio</code> package was accessible by applets in
JDK 1.1. However, in Java SE the applet sandbox was closed up.
Thus, applets trying to access any class libraries in the
<code>sun.audio</code> package will result in
<code>SecurityException</code>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the applet sandbox in
Java Plug-in has been opened up to allow applets to again access
the <code>sun.audio</code> package.</p>
<h2>Unable to find resources from
<code>AppletContext.getAudioClip()</code> and
<code>AppletContext.getImage()</code></h2>
<p>For the Microsoft and Sun implementations, the resource lookup
sequence in <code>AppletContext.getImage()</code> and
<code>AppletContext.getAudioClip()</code> is different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Microsoft implementation, resources are looked up in the
following sequence:<br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Archives specified through HTML <code>archive</code> or
<code>cabbase</code> parameters</li>
<li><code>codebase</code> URL</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Sun implementation, resources are looked up simply by
<i>codebase</i> URL.</p>
<p>As a result, some applets relying on the resources lookup
sequence of the Microsoft VM may not load resources properly in
Java SE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the resources lookup
sequence in Java Plug-in has been changed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Archives specified through HTML <code>archive</code>
parameters</li>
<li><code>codebase</code> URL</li>
</ol>
<h2><code>ClassLoader</code> sharing policy</h2>
<p>The <code>ClassLoader</code> sharing policy is different in the
Microsoft and Sun implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Microsoft implementation, a <code>ClassLoader</code>
object is shared between applets if and only if:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>codebase</code> values are the same,</li>
<li><code>archive</code> values are the same, and</li>
<li><code>cabbase</code> values are the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Sun implementation, a <code>ClassLoader</code> object is
shared between applets if and only if <code>codebase</code> values
are the same.</p>
<p>Some applets relying on the <code>ClassLoader</code> sharing
policy of the Microsoft implementation may not run properly in Java
SE because of potential class definition conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the
<code>ClassLoader</code> sharing policy in Java Plug-in has been
changed. A <code>ClassLoader</code> object is now shared between
applets if and only if:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>codebase</code> values are the same,</li>
<li><code>cache_archive</code> values are the same,</li>
<li><code>java_archive</code> values are the same, and</li>
<li><code>archive</code> values are the same.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security model&#8212;Java SE VS Microsoft</h2>
<p>Java SE has a new security model which provides much more
capability and flexibility than JDK 1.1, while Microsoft's VM
security model is based on JDK 1.1 and its own proprietary
technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable. Thus, an applet that relies on the
Microsoft's security model will not run properly in Java SE.</p>
<h2>Applet packaging</h2>
<p>Applet packaging in Java SE and JDK 1.1 is through
<code>.jar</code> files, whereas the Microsoft VM supports applet
packaging through <code>.jar</code> files and its own proprietary
<code>.cab</code> (cabinet) files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable. Thus, an applet packaged in Microsoft
<code>.cab</code> file format will not be loaded in Java SE.</p>
<h2>Java language specification strictness (<code>null</code> vs
zero-length string)</h2>
<p>In JDK 1.1 the Java language specification was loose in dealing
with <code>null</code> and zero-length strings in the class
libraries. Some APIs may treat a zero-length string as
<code>null</code>, while other APIs may treat <code>null</code> as
it is. In Java SE, the Java language specification has been
tightened up to specify what the exact behavior should be.</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable. Thus, in Java SE an applet that
relies on the APIs to treat <code>null</code> as a zero-length
string may result in an exception.</p>
<h2>Applet signing&#8212;RSA vs Authenticode</h2>
<p>In Java SE, applet signing is supported through RSA and the
<code>.jar</code> file, whereas Microsoft supports applet signing
through its own proprietary Authenticode and <code>.cab</code> file
technologies.</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable. Thus an applet that relies on
Microsoft's Authenticode and <code>.cab</code> file technologies
may not load properly in Java SE.</p>
<h2>Implementation changes in AWT class libraries</h2>
<p>In the past, some programmers assumed that AWT was thread safe.
Therefore some applets were written using AWT libraries that
interacted with the GUI in multiple threads, assuming that the
class libraries took care of synchronization issues. In fact,
neither AWT nor Swing are thread safe. Therefore, all code that
updates the GUI or processes events should occur on the event
dispatching thread. Failure to do so may result in a deadlock or
race condition. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html">
Concurrenecy in Swing</a> in <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/">The Swing
Tutorial</a>. Although this tutorial specifically covers Swing, in
this instance, the same rules apply to all
<code>Component</code>s.</p>
<h2>Java/JavaScript communication</h2>
<p>In the Microsoft implementation, an applet's methods and
properties exposed in JavaScript in an HTML page are exactly the
same as the methods and properties of the applet object. In Java
Plug-in, an applet's methods and properties are exposed in
JavaScript in an HTML page through JavaBeans Introspection, which
analyzes methods and properties through naming conventions in the
applet object. The side effect is that applet's fields are treated
differently.</p>
<p>This problem will be fixed in a future release of Java Plug-in.
In the meantime, JavaScript access to fields in the applet object
may not work properly in Java SE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Microsoft proprietary Java classes, methods, and variables</h2>
<p>Microsoft has provided many proprietary class libraries in its
VM implementation, including J/Direct, AFC, WFC, etc. For other
classes, methods, and variables, see <a href=
"http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-1997/jw-10-sdk.html">How
to avoid potential pitfalls of Microsoft's non-standard SDK for
Java</a>.</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable. Thus, applets that rely on any of the
Microsoft proprietary Java class libraries will not work properly
in Java SE.</p>
<h2>Whitespace characters in strings returned from
<code>Applet.getParameter()</code></h2>
<p>In the Microsoft implementation, whitespace characters are
stripped off before the string is returned to an applet in
<code>Applet.getParameter()</code>. On the other hand, Sun's
implementation returns the string as it is specified in the HTML
parameters. As a result, some JDK 1.1 applets refuse to run in Java
SE because the applet's logic doesn't take the whitespace into
account.</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the implementation of
<code>Applet.getParameter()</code> in Java Plug-in has been changed
to strip off whitespace characters in the return value.</p>
<h2>Design changes in
<code>java.util.Hashtable.hashCode()</code><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p>In JDK 1.1, <code>Hashtable.hashCode()</code> was implemented
based on the object identity; thus, each <code>Hashtable</code>
object returns its unique value when <code>hashCode()</code> is
called. In Java SE, the implementation of
<code>Hashtable.hashCode()</code> was changed to be value-based as
part of the Java Collection Framework. A <code>Hashtable</code>
object returns its hashcode value based on the objects it
contains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change breaks some JDK 1.1 applets if they add a
<code>Hashtable</code> object into itself, which breaks the
fundamental design of the Collection Framework and causes
<code>StackOverflowError</code>. It breaks logic in some applet
code that relies on <code>Hashtable.hashCode()</code> to return a
constant value from the same <code>Hashtable</code> object.</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the implementation of
<code>Hashtable.hashCode()</code> has been changed to check for
this special case to avoid stack overflow.</p>
<h2>Accessing frame from applet</h2>
<p>To track mouse events or for some other reasons, an applet may
sometimes try to access its frame . In the Microsoft and Sun
implementations, the number of containers between the frame and the
applet is different.</p>
<p>An applet that relies on a frame being at a particular level of
containment in the Microsoft VM, without navigating the entire AWT
hierarchical component tree, is likely to fail in Java SE. The most
common symptom is <code>ClassCastException</code> from the AWT
Dispatch Event Thread.</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable. Thus, an applet with this issue may
not run properly in Java SE.</p>
<h2><code>MAYSCRIPT</code></h2>
<p>In Netscape Navigator and Java Plug-in, an applet accessing
JavaScript is required to specify the <code>MAYSCRIPT</code>
attribute in the applet element. Microsoft's implementation,
however, doesn't honor this special parameter; it allows an applet
to access JavaScript under all conditions. Since most of Internet
applets target Microsoft's VM instead of Netscape's,
<code>MAYSCRIPT</code> is not specified in these applets.</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the
<code>MAYSCRIPT</code> check has been removed from Java
Plug-in.</p>
<h2>HTTP <code>User-Agent</code></h2>
<p>In the Microsoft and Sun implementations, different HTTP
<code>User-Agent</code> strings are passed to the server when an
HTTP connection is requested. Most web sites target Microsoft's VM
instead of Sun's and do not recognize Sun's HTTP
<code>User-Agent.</code>This may result in failure.</p>
<p>For that reason, the HTTP <code>User-Agent</code> string used in
Java Plug-in has been made similar to the Microsoft one. Thus, most
web servers will recognize requests made from applets running in
Java Plug-in.</p>
<h2>Events during applet startup and shutdown</h2>
<p>In the Microsoft and Sun implementations, the events occurring
during applet startup and shutdown may not be exactly the same. For
example, the logic in the applet may rely on the applet being
visible when <code>Applet.start()</code> or
<code>Applet.stop()</code> is called, which may be true in the
Microsoft implementation but not in Sun implementation.</p>
<p>An applet that relies on specific events during applet startup
and shutdown in the Microsoft VM may not function properly in Java
SE. The most common symptom is <code>NullPointerException</code>
from the AWT Dispatch Event Thread.</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable.</p>
<h2>Java class libraries compatibility<b>&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p>There are many changes in the Java class libraries and Java SE.
Some APIs are clarified, some are depreciated, and some have
altered implementations. The following have caused some applets run
in the Microsoft VM to fail in Java SE:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>java.awt.Graphics.drawString()</code><i><br /></i><br />
<code>drawString()</code> treats <code>null</code> as an empty
string in the Microsoft VM. In Java SE, <code>drawString()</code>
treats <code>null</code> as it is and throws
<code>NullPointerException</code>.<br /></li>
<li><code>java.awt.Graphics.drawImage()</code><i><br />
<br /></i> <code>drawImage()</code> ignores <code>null</code> image
in the Microsoft VM. In Java SE, <code>drawImage()</code> treats
<code>null</code> as it is and throws
<code>NullPointerException</code>.<br /></li>
<li><code>java.awt.Color</code> constructors<br />
<br />
In the Microsoft VM, passing over-bound/under-bound values in the
<code>Color</code> constructor will cause the VM to print out a
warning message in the console, but the values will be reset to
max/min automatically. In Java SE, <code>Color</code> constructor
checks for illegal values and throws
<code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.<br /></li>
<li><code>Thread.stop(), Thread.suspend(),
Thread.resume()</code><i><br />
<br /></i> In the Microsoft VM, stopping, suspending, or resuming a
dead thread will cause the call to be ignored. In Java SE, calling
these methods on a dead thread will result in
<code>AccessControlException</code>.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Applets affected by these issues will result in exceptions and
may not run properly in Java SE.</p>
<h2>Java Moniker</h2>
<p>This is a proprietary Microsoft technology that is not supported
by Java SE.</p>
<h2><code>object</code> attribute with <code>PARAM</code>
element</h2>
<p>With the conventional applet format, use of an attribute named
<code>object</code> with a <code>PARAM</code> element will cause an
exception with the Sun VM: 'Either "code" or "object" should be
specified, but not both.' With the Microsoft VM, no exception will
be thrown. This is a compatibility issue. To avoid the exception
with the Sun VM, do not use an attribute named <code>object</code>
with a <code>PARAM</code> element in an applet.</p>
