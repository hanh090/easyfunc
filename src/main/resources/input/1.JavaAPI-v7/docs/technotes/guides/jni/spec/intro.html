<a name="wp16173" id="wp16173"></a>
<p class="pBody">This chapter introduces the <em class=
"cEmphasis">Java Native Interface</em> (JNI). The JNI is a native
programming interface. It allows Java code that runs inside a Java
Virtual Machine (VM) to interoperate with applications and
libraries written in other programming languages, such as C, C++,
and assembly.</p>
<a name="wp426" id="wp426"></a>
<p class="pBody">The most important benefit of the JNI is that it
imposes no restrictions on the implementation of the underlying
Java VM. Therefore, Java VM vendors can add support for the JNI
without affecting other parts of the VM. Programmers can write one
version of a native application or library and expect it to work
with all Java VMs supporting the JNI.</p>
<a name="wp514" id="wp514"></a>
<p class="pBody">This chapter covers the following topics:</p>

<h2 class="pHeading1">Java Native Interface Overview</h2>
<a name="wp16636" id="wp16636"></a>
<p class="pBody">While you can write applications entirely in Java,
there are situations where Java alone does not meet the needs of
your application. Programmers use the JNI to write <em class=
"cEmphasis">Java native methods</em> to handle those situations
when an application cannot be written entirely in Java.</p>
<a name="wp16650" id="wp16650"></a>
<p class="pBody">The following examples illustrate when you need to
use Java native methods:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em" class="pBullet1"><a name="wp16651"
id="wp16651"></a>
<div class="pBullet1">
<ul>
<li>The standard Java class library does not support the
platform-dependent features needed by the application.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16654" id="wp16654"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>You already have a library written in another language, and
wish to make it accessible to Java code through the JNI.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16656" id="wp16656"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Last">
<ul>
<li>You want to implement a small portion of time-critical code in
a lower-level language such as assembly.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<a name="wp16395" id="wp16395"></a>
<p class="pBody">By programming through the JNI, you can use native
methods to:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em" class="pBullet1"><a name="wp16398"
id="wp16398"></a>
<div class="pBullet1">
<ul>
<li>Create, inspect, and update Java objects (including arrays and
strings).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16396" id="wp16396"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>Call Java methods.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16404" id="wp16404"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>Catch and throw exceptions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16407" id="wp16407"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>Load classes and obtain class information.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16659" id="wp16659"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Last">
<ul>
<li>Perform runtime type checking.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<a name="wp16360" id="wp16360"></a>
<p class="pBody">You can also use the JNI with the <em class=
"cEmphasis">Invocation API</em> to enable an arbitrary native
application to embed the Java VM. This allows programmers to easily
make their existing applications Java-enabled without having to
link with the VM source code.</p>
<a name="wp16230" id="wp16230"></a>
<h2 class="pHeading1">Historical Background</h2>
<a name="wp16412" id="wp16412"></a>
<p class="pBody">VMs from different vendors offer different native
method interfaces. These different interfaces force programmers to
produce, maintain, and distribute multiple versions of native
method libraries on a given platform.</p>
<a name="wp16679" id="wp16679"></a>
<p class="pBody">We briefly examine some of the native method
interfaces, such as:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em" class="pBullet1"><a name="wp16685"
id="wp16685"></a>
<div class="pBullet1">
<ul>
<li>JDK 1.0 native method interface</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16688" id="wp16688"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>Netscape&#8217;s Java Runtime Interface</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16689" id="wp16689"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Last">
<ul>
<li>Microsoft&#8217;s Raw Native Interface and Java/COM
interface</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<a name="wp16684" id="wp16684"></a>
<h3 class="pHeading2">JDK 1.0 Native Method Interface</h3>
<a name="wp16555" id="wp16555"></a>
<p class="pBody">JDK 1.0 was shipped with a native method
interface. Unfortunately, there were two major reasons that this
interface was unsuitable for adoption by other Java VMs.</p>
<a name="wp16700" id="wp16700"></a>
<p class="pBody">First, the native code accessed fields in Java
objects as members of C structures. However, the <em class=
"cEmphasis">Java Language Specification</em> does not define how
objects are laid out in memory. If a Java VM lays out objects
differently in memory, then the programmer would have to recompile
the native method libraries.</p>
<a name="wp16705" id="wp16705"></a>
<p class="pBody">Second, JDK 1.0&#8217;s native method interface
relied on a conservative garbage collector. The unrestricted use of
the <code class="cCode">unhand</code> macro, for example, made it
necessary to conservatively scan the native stack.</p>
<a name="wp16413" id="wp16413"></a>
<h3 class="pHeading2">Java Runtime Interface</h3>
<a name="wp16706" id="wp16706"></a>
<p class="pBody">Netscape had proposed the Java Runtime Interface
(JRI), a general interface for services provided in the Java
virtual machine. JRI was designed with portability in mind---it
makes few assumptions about the implementation details in the
underlying Java VM. The JRI addressed a wide range of issues,
including native methods, debugging, reflection, embedding
(invocation), and so on.</p>
<a name="wp16442" id="wp16442"></a>
<h3 class="pHeading2">Raw Native Interface and Java/COM
Interface</h3>
<a name="wp16707" id="wp16707"></a>
<p class="pBody">The Microsoft Java VM supports two native method
interfaces. At the low level, it provides an efficient Raw Native
Interface (RNI). The RNI offers a high degree of source-level
backward compatibility with the JDK&#8217;s native method
interface, although it has one major difference. Instead of relying
on conservative garbage collection, the native code must use RNI
functions to interact explicitly with the garbage collector.</p>
<a name="wp16713" id="wp16713"></a>
<p class="pBody">At a higher level, Microsoft&#39;s Java/COM
interface offers a language-independent standard binary interface
to the Java VM. Java code can use a COM object as if it were a Java
object. A Java class can also be exposed to the rest of the system
as a COM class.</p>
<a name="wp16410" id="wp16410"></a>
<h2 class="pHeading1">Objectives</h2>
<a name="wp16664" id="wp16664"></a>
<p class="pBody">We believe that a uniform, well-thought-out
standard interface offers the following benefits for everyone:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em" class="pBullet1"><a name="wp16184"
id="wp16184"></a>
<div class="pBullet1">
<ul>
<li>Each VM vendor can support a larger body of native code.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16186" id="wp16186"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>Tool builders will not have to maintain different kinds of
native method interfaces.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16268" id="wp16268"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Last">
<ul>
<li>Application programmers will be able to write one version of
their native code and this version will run on different VMs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<a name="wp16250" id="wp16250"></a>
<p class="pBody">The best way to achieve a standard native method
interface is to involve all parties with an interest in Java VMs.
Therefore we organized a series of discussions among the Java
licensees on the design of a uniform native method interface. It is
clear from the discussions that the standard native method
interface must satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em" class="pBullet1"><a name="wp16251"
id="wp16251"></a>
<div class="pBullet1">
<ul>
<li>Binary compatibility - The primary goal is binary compatibility
of native method libraries across all Java VM implementations on a
given platform. Programmers should maintain only one version of
their native method libraries for a given platform.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16463" id="wp16463"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>Efficiency - To support time-critical code, the native method
interface must impose little overhead. All known techniques to
ensure VM-independence (and thus binary compatibility) carry a
certain amount of overhead. We must somehow strike a compromise
between efficiency and VM-independence.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp16464" id="wp16464"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Last">
<ul>
<li>Functionality - The interface must expose enough Java VM
internals to allow native methods to accomplish useful tasks.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<a name="wp16465" id="wp16465"></a>
<h2 class="pHeading1">Java Native Interface Approach</h2>
<a name="wp16528" id="wp16528"></a>
<p class="pBody">We hoped to adopt one of the existing approaches
as the standard interface, because this would have imposed the
least burden on programmers who had to learn multiple interfaces in
different VMs. Unfortunately, no existing solutions are completely
satisfactory in achieving our goals.</p>
<a name="wp16473" id="wp16473"></a>
<p class="pBody">Netscape&#8217;s JRI is the closest to what we
envision as a portable native method interface, and was used as the
starting point of our design. Readers familiar with the JRI will
notice the similarities in the API naming convention, the use of
method and field IDs, the use of local and global references, and
so on. Despite our best efforts, however, the JNI is not
binary-compatible with the JRI, although a VM can support both the
JRI and the JNI.</p>
<a name="wp16835" id="wp16835"></a>
<p class="pBody">Microsoft&#8217;s RNI was an improvement over JDK
1.0 because it solved the problem of native methods working with a
nonconservative garbage collector. The RNI, however, was not
suitable as a VM-independent native method interface. Like the JDK,
RNI native methods access Java objects as C structures, leading to
two problems:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em" class="pBullet1"><a name="wp438" id=
"wp438"></a>
<div class="pBullet1">
<ul>
<li>RNI exposed the layout of internal Java objects to native
code.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp452" id="wp452"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Last">
<ul>
<li>Direct access of Java objects as C structures makes it
impossible to efficiently incorporate &#8220;write barriers,&#8221;
which are necessary in advanced garbage collection algorithms.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<a name="wp16838" id="wp16838"></a>
<p class="pBody">As a binary standard, COM ensures complete binary
compatibility across different VMs. Invoking a COM method requires
only an indirect call, which carries little overhead. In addition,
COM objects are a great improvement over dynamic-link libraries in
solving versioning problems.</p>
<a name="wp16815" id="wp16815"></a>
<p class="pBody">The use of COM as the standard Java native method
interface, however, is hampered by a few factors:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em" class="pBullet1"><a name="wp343" id=
"wp343"></a>
<div class="pBullet1">
<ul>
<li>First, the Java/COM interface lacks certain desired functions,
such as accessing private fields and raising general
exceptions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp456" id="wp456"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>Second, the Java/COM interface automatically provides the
standard IUnknown and IDispatch COM interfaces for Java objects, so
that native code can access public methods and fields.
Unfortunately, the IDispatch interface does not deal with
overloaded Java methods and is case-insensitive in matching method
names. Furthermore, all Java methods exposed through the IDispatch
interface are wrapped to perform dynamic type checking and
coercion. This is because the IDispatch interface is designed with
weakly-typed languages (such as Basic) in mind.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp344" id="wp344"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>Third, instead of dealing with individual low-level functions,
COM is designed to allow software components (including
full-fledged applications) to work together. We believe that it is
not appropriate to treat all Java classes or low-level native
methods as software components.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp345" id="wp345"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Last">
<ul>
<li>Fourth, the immediate adoption of COM is hampered by the lack
of its support on UNIX platforms.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<a name="wp16519" id="wp16519"></a>
<p class="pBody">Although Java objects are not exposed to the
native code as COM objects, the JNI interface itself is
binary-compatible with COM. JNI uses the same jump table structure
and calling convention that COM does. <em class="cEmphasis">This
means that, as soon as cross-platform support for COM is available,
the JNI can become a COM interface to the Java VM.</em></p>
<a name="wp16492" id="wp16492"></a>
<p class="pBody">JNI is not believed to be the only native method
interface supported by a given Java VM. A standard interface
benefits programmers, who would like to load their native code
libraries into different Java VMs. In some cases, the programmer
may have to use a lower-level, VM-specific interface to achieve top
efficiency. In other cases, the programmer might use a higher-level
interface to build software components. Indeed, as the Java
environment and component software technologies become more mature,
native methods will gradually lose their significance.</p>
<a name="wp16539" id="wp16539"></a>
<h2 class="pHeading1">Programming to the JNI</h2>
<a name="wp16540" id="wp16540"></a>
<p class="pBody">Native method programmers should program to the
JNI. Programming to the JNI insulates you from unknowns, such as
the vendor&#8217;s VM that the end user might be running. By
conforming to the JNI standard, you will give a native library the
best chance to run in a given Java VM.</p>
<a name="wp647" id="wp647"></a>
<p class="pBody">If you are implementing a Java VM, you should
implement the JNI. JNI has been time tested and ensured to not
impose any overhead or restrictions on your VM implementation,
including object representation, garbage collection scheme, and so
on. Please send us your feedback if you run into any problems we
may have overlooked.</p>
<a name="wp648" id="wp648"></a>
<h2 class="pHeading1">Changes</h2>
<a name="wp649" id="wp649"></a>
<p class="pBody">As of Java SE 6.0, the deprecated structures
JDK1_1InitArgs and JDK1_1AttachArgs have been removed, instead
JavaVMInitArgs and JavaVMAttachArgs are to be used.</p>
